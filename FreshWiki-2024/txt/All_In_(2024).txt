All_In_(2024)

The 2024 All In, also promoted as All In London at Wembley Stadium or simply All In London, was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the American promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It was the second annual All In by AEW, and third All In overall. The event took place on August 25, 2024, at Wembley Stadium in London, England, coinciding with the United Kingdom's August Bank Holiday weekend.
Twelve matches were contested at the event, including three on the Zero-Hour pre-show. In the main event, Bryan Danielson defeated Swerve Strickland in a Title vs. Career match to win the AEW World Championship, making him the fourth wrestler to win the AEW World Championship and WWE Championship.

The event also featured the in-ring return of English wrestler and London native Nigel McGuinness following his retirement in 2011 and subsequent transition into color commentary.

# Production

## Background

All In was first held as an independent professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event in September 2018, and was produced by members of The Elite in association with Ring of Honor (ROH), which retained the rights to All In. The event inspired the formation of the American promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) in January 2019,  and after AEW president Tony Khan purchased ROH in March 2022,  AEW revived All In as their first-ever PPV event held in the United Kingdom, which took place during the 2023 August Bank Holiday weekend at Wembley Stadium in London, England [4] [5] [6] [7]. At the conclusion of the 2023 event, AEW announced that All In would return to Wembley Stadium on August 25, 2024 [8]. Tickets went on sale on December 1, 2023 [9]. The day before the event on Saturday, August 24, AEW hosted a fan event called All In Celebration. The event was held at Boxpark Wembley and featured music, early access to All In merchandise, and several stage shows, interviews, and content featuring various AEW wrestlers. 

## Storylines

All In London at Wembley Stadium featured professional wrestling matches that were the result of pre-existing feuds and storylines, with results being predetermined by AEW's writers. Storylines were produced on AEW's weekly television programs, Dynamite, Collision, and Rampage, and the YouTube series Being The Dark Order. The Owen Hart Cup is an annual professional wrestling tournament held by AEW in partnership with The Owen Hart Foundation in honor of Owen Hart. It consists of two single-elimination tournaments, one each for men and women, and the respective winners receive a trophy called "The Owen" as well as a commemorative championship belt. During Double or Nothing on May 26, AEW president Tony Khan and Owen's widow Martha announced that the respective 2024 cup winners would also earn a world championship match at All In. Both tournament finals occurred on the July 10 episode of Dynamite in Owen's hometown of Calgary, Alberta, Canada [13]. The women's Owen Hart Foundation Tournament was won by Mariah May. After losing the AEW Women's World Championship at Dynamite 200 in August 2023, Toni Storm underwent a shift in character; her new persona was that of a paranoid Golden Age of Hollywood starlet, similar to the character of Norma Desmond in the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard [14]. Storm would take on the epithet of "Timeless" Toni Storm starting in October 2023, and would be accompanied by her "butler" Luther, who was portraying a similar role to that of Sunset Boulevard's Max von Mayerling, with Storm being billed from Stage 7 at Warner Bros [15]. Studios. In November, World Wonder Ring Stardom wrestler Mariah May debuted as a heel and a "superfan" of Storm; while initially dismissive of May, Storm later took May on as her "understudy", and Storm regained the AEW Women's World Championship at Full Gear that month. Subsequently, at Revolution in March 2024, May took on Storm's old "rockstar" gimmick [16]. Throughout the following months, Storm and May's relationship developed romantic overtones, and as a gift, Storm entered May into the Owen Hart Cup: May would defeat 2023 winner Willow Nightingale in the tournament final to earn a match against Storm for the AEW Women's World Championship at All In [17]. After the match, May turned on Storm, hitting her with the Owen Hart Cup championship belt and bloodying her in the process;  this explicitly aligned May's persona to the character of Eve Harrington in the 1950 film All About Eve, whose primary ambition in the film was to supplant Margo Channing—another inspiration for Storm's character—as a Hollywood star [14]. May subsequently took on the epithet "The Glamour" Mariah May [18]. The men's Owen Hart tournament was won by Bryan Danielson. Danielson, who made his AEW debut at the 2021 All Out, previously challenged for the AEW World Championship at Revolution in 2023, but was unsuccessful in the bout [14]. In a backstage interview on the following Dynamite, Danielson teased a possible retirement storyline; he said the championship match made him realize he was putting wrestling ahead of his family [20]. On the September 9, 2023, episode of Collision, Danielson confirmed that 2024 would be his last year as a full-time wrestler [21]. Throughout the following year, Danielson would suffer a losing streak in marquee matches, which included losing in the 2023 Continental Classic tournament, losses in high-profile singles matches at New Japan Pro-Wrestling's (NJPW) Wrestle Kingdom 18 and AEW's Dynasty, and being on the losing team in the Anarchy in the Arena match at Double or Nothing [22]. As a result, on the June 6 episode of Dynamite, Danielson became the first wrestler to declare for the 2024 Owen Hart Cup and vowed to "go out on top". Danielson would then go on to win the tournament, defeating "Hangman" Adam Page—who himself was seeking vengeance against his rival, reigning AEW World Champion Swerve Strickland—in the tournament final [23]. On the July 31 episode of Dynamite, Danielson said if he did not defeat Strickland and win the AEW World Championship at All In, he would never wrestle again; they subsequently agreed that the stipulation would be a Title vs [14]. Career match. This match was then billed as "The Final Countdown". At Dynamite 250 on July 17, MJF defeated Will Ospreay to win the AEW International Championship. The following week, MJF threw the International Championship belt in the trash and replaced it with his own custom championship belt, which he unofficially renamed as the American Championship [25]. Ospreay interrupted and announced that he would be facing MJF in a rematch for the title at All In. On the July 31 episode, Ospreay said that after he regained the title, he would restore it as the International Championship [26]. At Double or Nothing, Darby Allin joined Team AEW against The Elite, but Team AEW were defeated by The Elite in the Anarchy in the Arena match, a match in which Allin set Elite member Jack Perry on fire with a flamethrower. After taking a brief hiatus, Allin returned on the July 10 episode of Dynamite and attacked Elite member Brandon Cutler to send a warning to The Elite [27]. Allin again joined Team AEW against The Elite for the Blood and Guts match at Dynamite: Blood & Guts [28]. Team AEW won by way of Allin causing The Elite to forfeit by threatening to set Perry on fire, who Allin had handcuffed to the cage, while simultaneously making The Elite agree to give him a match against Perry for the AEW TNT Championship at All In. After a backstage brawl on the August 14 episode, Perry declared he would defend the title against Allin in a Coffin match, which was made official [29]. After Mercedes Moné retained the AEW TBS Championship at Forbidden Door, where she simultaneously won the NJPW Strong Women's Championship, Moné's celebration was interrupted by the returning Dr. Britt Baker, D.M.D., who had been out since September 2023. On the following Dynamite, Baker explained that she had been out for 10 months due to a diagnosis of a Transient Ischemic Attack [31]. She was then interrupted by Moné, after which, Baker challenged Moné to a championship match at All In, but Moné declined. However, after a confrontation between the two during AEW's panel at San Diego Comic-Con on July 25, Tony Khan officially scheduled Moné to defend the TBS Championship against Baker at All In [32].

Christian Cage came out and was immediately taken out by Ricochet who dived on him as be made his way to the ring. Karen distracted Page so Jeff Jarrett could hit him with his guitar.
