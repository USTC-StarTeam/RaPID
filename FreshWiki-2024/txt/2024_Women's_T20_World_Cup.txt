# Background

The ICC Women's T20 World Cup is a professional WT20I tournament held between women's national cricket teams, organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The tournament, now being held every two years, was first played in 2009 in England. The last tournament held in 2023 in South Africa was contested by 10 teams [7]. The defending champions were Australia, who defeated South Africa in the final of the previous edition. 

## Host selection

In July 2022, the ICC announced that the 2024 Women's T20 World Cup would be played in Bangladesh. In August 2024, the ICC announced that the 2024 Women's T20 World Cup would be played in the United Arab Emirates, with the Bangladesh Cricket Board remaining the official hosts [10]. 

## Format

The 10 qualifying teams were divided into two groups of five teams; all the five teams in a group played with all the others – for a total of ten matches – and the top two teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage. 

## Schedule

On 28 July 2024, ICC announced that the tournament will be played from 3 to 20 October 2024. [citation needed] It was scheduled to be hosted in Bangladesh. However, it was later relocated to the United Arab Emirates for the same dates in August 2024. On 16 August 2024, ICC announced that warm-up fixtures will be held from 27 September to 1 October [11]. [citation needed] However, on 27 August 2024, after the announcement of the revised schedule, the warm-up fixtures were scheduled to be held from 28 September to 1 October. 

## Prize money

The ICC allocated a pool of US$7,958,080 in prize money for the tournament. The winners would earn at least $2.34 million. In addition, each team will receive an additional $31,154 for each match they win excluding the semi-finals and final. 

# Qualification

In April 2022, the ICC confirmed the qualification process for the tournament. The hosts, Bangladesh along with the top six teams from the 2023 tournament qualified automatically for the tournament. The remaining automatic qualification spot was taken by the best-ranked team in the ICC Women's T20I Team Rankings which had not already qualified, as of 27 February 2023. The two remaining places were filled via the global qualifier, in which teams advanced from the regional qualifiers competed for it. [7]. Scotland qualified for the Women's T20 World Cup for the first time after defeating Ireland in the first semi-final of the qualifier. Sri Lanka became the second qualifier and reached their ninth T20 World Cup after defeating United Arab Emirates in the second semi-final [18] [19]. Overall, nine out of ten teams from 2023 reached the T20 World Cup, with the only difference being Scotland replacing Ireland [20]. 

# Venues

In July 2022, the Bangladesh Cricket Board confirmed that two venues, Dhaka and Sylhet, would host the matches. Dhaka was to host the final, although Sylhet was originally meant to host the finals [23]. Later, in August 2024, ICC announced that the United Arab Emirates will host the Women's T20 World Cup instead of Bangladesh due to internal conflicts in Bangladesh, although the BCB will retain the hosting rights to the event [23]. The matches are being played at Dubai and Sharjah.
