2024_Stanley_Cup_playoffs

The 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2023–24 season. The playoffs began on April 20, 2024, and concluded on June 24, 2024, with the Florida Panthers winning their first Stanley Cup in franchise history, defeating the Edmonton Oilers four games to three in the Stanley Cup Finals.
The New York Rangers made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. Both the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs extended their respective playoff streaks to eight consecutive seasons, the longest active streaks in the NHL. For the second year in a row and third time since entering the NHL as expansion teams in the 1967–68 NHL season, both Pennsylvania-based teams (the Flyers and Penguins) missed the playoffs in the same season. Marc-Andre Fleury missed the playoffs for the first time since 2006.
For the fifth consecutive season, a Florida-based team reached the Stanley Cup Finals. For the first time since 2015, the New York Rangers became the only Presidents' Trophy winning team to hold this award twice and advance to the semifinal round of the playoffs in the last ten years. While the Oilers knocked off the division champion Canucks, this was the first time since 2018 that three of the four conference finalists – the Rangers, Panthers and Stars – were their respective division champions. During game four of the Stanley Cup Finals, Connor McDavid set the playoff record for most assists in one year, eclipsing the previous record set by Wayne Gretzky in 1988. The Edmonton Oilers became the tenth team to tie a series after trailing 3–0 in a series and the third team to do so in the Stanley Cup Finals.

# Playoff bracket

In each round, teams competed in a best-of-seven series following a 2–2–1–1–1 format (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). The team with home ice advantage played at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team played at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top three teams in each division made the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference, for a total of eight teams from each conference. In the first round, the lower seeded wild card in the conference played against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card played against the other division winner, and both wild cards were de facto #4 seeds. The other series matched the second and third-place teams from the divisions. In the first two rounds, home-ice advantage was awarded to the team with the better seed.

# Media

## Canada

In Canada, this marked the tenth postseason under Rogers Media's 12-year contract. Games aired across the Sportsnet networks and CBC under the Hockey Night in Canada brand. For first and second-round U.S.–U.S. games not on CBC, Sportsnet generally simulcasts the U.S. feed instead of producing their own telecast. The 2024 Stanley Cup Finals will be simulcast on both CBC and Sportsnet. Sportsnet+ streams every game. CBC Gem was not streaming games televised on CBC this postseason, and any first-round games that appeared on that streaming service was due to an error [96]. 

## United States

In the U.S., this marked the third year of a seven-year agreement with the ESPN family of Networks and TNT Sports.. First round games were split between ESPN-produced telecasts (either on ESPN, ABC, or ESPN2) and TNT Sports-produced telecasts (either on TNT or TBS, with selected simulcasts on TruTV), while working around their 2024 NBA playoffs telecasts and other broadcasting commitments. Each U.S. team's regional broadcaster also televised local coverage of first-round games, except for games on ABC. With the Stanley Cup playoffs starting on the same day as the NBA playoffs this year, in the first round, ESPN or ESPN2 aired games on Monday through Thursday nights, TNT on Friday nights, TBS on Saturdays and Sundays and TruTV simulcasts all TNT-Sports produced games with some exceptions (ESPN and ESPN2 aired the opening Sunday of games, TNT airing one Sunday game on the middle weekend, TBS aired select games on Tuesday–Thursdays and ABC aired one Saturday night game on the final weekend). In the second round, ESPN aired games on Monday through Wednesday nights, TNT on Thursday and Friday nights, with weekend games split between all broadcasters (with ESPN airing the opening Sunday, TNT/TBS airing the middle weekend, and ESPN airing one the final Saturday). ESPN/ABC had the first choice of which conference final series to air, choosing the Eastern Conference finals this season, and TNT aired the Western Conference finals. As per the alternating rotation, ABC has coverage of the 2024 Stanley Cup Finals. This was the first playoff that the streaming service Max had live access to all TNT Sports-produced games on its Bleacher Report Sports add-on tier. ESPN+ streamed all ABC games and ESPN's Conference final games, along with replays of all games. [103]. This was the third of a four-year deal that Sports USA Radio Network was syndicating select Stanley Cup playoff games via NHL Radio across the U.S., including the entire conference finals and Stanley Cup Finals.
