# Plot

Maharaja is a quiet man who works as a barber in Ramki Saloon in Chennai. One day, a truck slams into a house he and his family were visiting, leading to his wife's death. His daughter, Jothi, survives when a dustbin accidentally falls and covers her. Maharaja and Jothi name the dustbin "Lakshmi" out of affection.. One day, Maharaja visits the local police station to report a robbery, citing that Lakshmi has been robbed, much to the amusement of the cops. He recounts the incident: an armed gang raided his house, attacked him, and took Lakshmi. The police do not want to invest effort in finding an empty dustbin but accept once he promises a bribe of ₹5 lakhs for the culprits. They rope in Nallasivam, an unofficial police informant.. Past (2009): Selvam and Sabari are two criminals who raid houses, rape women, and kill them. Selvam lives happily with his wife Kokila and baby daughter Ammu, who don't know what he really does for a living. One day, Sabari informs Selvam that their crimes are in the newspaper. Selvam happens to be in Ramki Saloon for a beard trim during the phone conversation and suspects that Maharaja overheard. He leaves but forgets a gold chain at the saloon that he wants to gift Ammu on her birthday. Maharaja visits Selvam's house to return it, but the police simultaneously arrive, gun down Sabari, and arrest Selvam, who believes that Maharaja exposed him. Kokila gets shocked after knowing the truth and disowns Selvam.. Present (2024): In the present, a delinquent named Dhana works in a car garage; Maharaja witnesses him get into a fight at a bar. Meanwhile, Nallasivam agrees to act as the perpetrator so as to "solve" the dustbin case. The police ask Maharaja over the phone to narrate the incident again so that Nallasivam can act accordingly.. Maharaja recounts the incident, but a flashback depicts the actual event, revealing that the incident happened not to him but to Jothi. Jothi had returned home from a sports camp organised by her P.T. teacher Aasifa, while Maharaja was still at work. Three men revealed to be Selvam, Dhana, and Nallasivam are in the house to kill him. Selvam still believes Maharaja ratted him out 14 years ago and vowed revenge, but Maharaja isn't at home. Instead, the trio physically assault Jothi, and Nallasivam rapes her multiple times. Jothi is hospitalised. Back home, a fallen receipt from Dhana leads Maharaja to the aforementioned bar fight Dhana was in. Dhana reveals that one of his accomplices is inside the police station itself before Maharaja beheads him. This is when he goes to the police station, as shown in the beginning, and invents a story about how his dustbin was stolen.. In the present, Inspector Varadharajan and his team take Nallasivam, now rather flustered, to Maharaja's home to return the dustbin. Varadharajan then reveals that his team had discovered Nallasivam's involvement in the rape of Jothi while investigating Dhana's death. Thus, they carried out the ruse of bringing him to Maharaja for vigilante justice, giving Maharaja the freedom to punish him. Maharaja kills him, but not before finding out who the third accomplice is. He arrives at the construction site where Selvam works, incapacitates him, and brings Jothi to him as per her wish. Jothi tosses a bag of jewellery at his face, assuming he had come to their home for it. Selvam finds the gold chain that he had bought for Ammu on her birthday—the very one that Maharaja had come to return so many years earlier.. The full scene from when Maharaja's wife died in the beginning is revealed with more context. After Selvam's arrest, Maharaja, his wife, and baby had come to Kokila's new house to return the chain. When Maharaja had gone to buy Ammu a gift from the shop across the street, a truck rammed into Kokila's house, killing everyone but Ammu, who was saved by the dustbin Lakshmi. Maharaja adopted Ammu, changed her name to Jothi, and raised her as his own daughter. In the present, Selvam sees a scar on Jothi's shoulder, the same one as Ammu, and realises that he had been unwittingly complicit in the rape and assault of his own daughter. Ammu leaves with Maharaja and her teacher Aasifa. Out of guilt, Selvam commits suicide by falling off the building.. 

# Production

After the success of Kurangu Bommai (2017), Nithilan Saminathan was signed by Sudhan Sundaram's Passion Studios to direct his next directorial under their production. However, the project was in development hell for several years due to unknown reasons [10]. Nithilan then narrated the script to G. Dhananjayan, who suggested to the director that he should narrate it to Vijay Antony, which he did and impressed the actor. Nithilan, however, had to receive a no-objection certificate (NOC) from Sundaram's production house [11]. The company was not in favour of passing the project to another house, therefore not giving the NOC. Soon after, the company then stated that they would narrate the script to Vijay Sethupathi, and if he declines being part of the film, they will pass the project. Sethupathi, who was impressed by the script, agreed to be part of the film, leading to him replacing Antony. Sundaram's company made a public announcement on 1 February 2023, confirming the project. The project would signify as Sethupathi's 50th film as a lead actor. Tentatively titled VJS50, principal photography began shortly after a muhurat puja held the same day at a film studio in Chennai with the presence of the film's cast and crew [13]. On 12 July, in addition to the principal photography wrapping, the film's official title, Maharaja, was announced by the production houses [14].

# Reception

## Critical response

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of 6 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.7/10 [32] [33]. Arjun Menon of Rediff.com gave 4/5 stars and wrote "Maharaja is a surprisingly novel outing, rejuvenating the tired tropes of revenge films with a morally challenging revelation in the final hour, that compensates for the little contrivances in the writing."  Manikandan KR of Times Now gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote "Maharaja is a fairly good revenge/investigative drama that primarily works because of fine performances from its entire cast and some exceptional work by its stuntmen and stunt choreographer."  Goutham S of Pinkvilla gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote "Vijay Sethupathi stands out in the action-packed revenge flick with a well-written screenplay by Nithilan Swaminathan" [35] [36]. Rakesh Tara of ABP News gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote "Maharaja is an ambitious attempt to blend serious societal issues with commercial cinema elements [37]. While it succeeds in parts, particularly through strong performances and engaging music, it falls short in delivering a cohesive and compelling narrative." [38]. Roopa Radhakrishnan of The Times of India gave 3/5 stars and wrote "Vijay Sethupathi is wonderful in his 50th film, and he has well-written role at his disposal."  Anusha Sundar of OTTPlay gave 3/5 stars and wrote "Maharaja is a film that feeds you information in every frame and second, so losing a grip on it might leave you unable to understand when the knots are tied."  Bhuvanesh Chandar of The Hindu wrote "Maharaja is yet another sign of the serious filmmaker Nithilan is, and shows us how a good writer can convert even a dated idea into a gripping big-screen experience."  Latha Srinivasan of Hindustan Times wrote "Director Nithilan Swaminathan and Vijay Sethupathi have delivered a film that’s definitely worthy of your time."  Swathi P Ajith of Onmanorama wrote "Maharaja is undoubtedly a thrilling revenge drama that deserves to be watched in theatres."  G.A [39] [40] [41] [42] [43]. Gowtham of Uyirmmai wrote "The film Maharaja wears the crown of Box office by its gripping screenplay."  Ananda Vikatan gave 48/100 and wrote this film gives punishment hiddenly to those who have similar thoughts on children [44]. Janani. K of India Today gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote "Maharaja has a lot going on. Sadly, the hits and misses are not proportional, with the latter having the upper hand. These good moments get buried under dark humour, which hardly works, and many other shortcomings."  B [46]. V. S. Prakash of Deccan Chronicle gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote "Director Nithilan deserves a pat since he makes the girl victim stronger and determined who wants to meet scrupulous characters and question them for their heinous act face-to-face and throws up another twist in the end."  Kirubhakar Purushothaman of The Indian Express gave 2/5 stars and wrote "The overarching problem with Maharaja is its ‘wannabe’ nature to come across as a gritty, dark, and emotional rollercoaster [47]. It is more concerned about how it wants to come across than what it really is.". Ananda vikatan rated the flim 45 out of 100 [48].
