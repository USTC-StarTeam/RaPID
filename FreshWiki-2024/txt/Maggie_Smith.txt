The theatre critic Michael Coveney wrote that during her eight years in the company, Smith developed a fierce rivalry with Olivier writing, "He knew immediately he'd met his match – that she was extraordinary. He said that anyone who can play comedy that well can also play tragedy and he offered her the likes of Desdemona in Shakespeare's Othello. But having got her into the company they became not enemies, but professional rivals. Never before had anyone on stage been quicker than him and now, it seemed, there was a contest." [21]. During a 1964 production of Othello, Olivier struck Smith across the face, knocking her out. She later recalled the incident on a 2015 edition of The Graham Norton Show and in the 2018  documentary Nothing Like a Dame [22].

Dave Kehr of Chicago Reader said that Smith gives "one of those technically stunning, emotionally distant performances that the British are so damn good at."  Greg Ferrara wrote that the film "is one of the best British films of the decade [36]. It is as captivating today as it was upon its release and its two central performances by Maggie Smith and Pamela Franklin are both stirring and mesmerizing.

The New York Times theatre critic praised Smith's physical comedic skills writing, "Miss Smith's body spins, lurches, misses yards at a time before another foot comes down, ends in a paralysis that will require hypnosis to undo [38]. The effect, because Noel Coward's situation is funny and because Miss Smith sends off that one little extra signal that spells extravagance, is hilarious, explosively so."  Smith received her first Tony Award nomination and a Drama Desk Award nomination [39]. In the mid-1970s, she made several guest appearances on The Carol Burnett Show.

The diplomat's wife observes everyone else's behaviour throughout. The play received mixed reviews with Walter Kerr of The New York Times praising Smith's performance while critiquing the characters writing, "Which leaves us, theatrically and dramatically, where we began, with Miss Smith.

In his New York Times review, Frank Rich wrote, "There is only one Maggie Smith, but audiences get at least three of her in Lettice and Lovage, the Peter Shaffer comedy that has brought this spellbinding actress back to Broadway after an indecently long absence and that has the shrewd sense to keep her glued to center stage." [60]. Smith portrayed Charlotte Bartlett in the Merchant Ivory Production of A Room with a View (1985). The film  received universal acclaim earning eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. The film also starred Helena Bonham Carter, Julian Sands, Daniel Day-Lewis, Dame Judi Dench, Simon Callow and Denholm Elliott.

Pauline Kael wrote: "Clayton is a felicitous choice to direct a character study film about a woman's rage against the Church for her wasted life [3]. His first feature was Room at the Top with Simone Signoret and he made The Innocents with Deborah Kerr and The Pumpkin Eater with Anne Bancroft – he knows how to show women's temperatures and their mind-body inter-actions. Maggie Smith becomes the essence of spinster – she makes you feel the ghastliness of knowing you're a figure of fun." . In the early 1990s, Smith appeared in various box-office comedies. In 1991 Smith appeared as Granny Wendy in Steven Spielberg's 1991 film Hook, a fantasy adventure film based on the Peter Pan character.

The following year she starred in Edward Albee's Three Tall Women for which she garnered critical acclaim. Theatre critic Paul Taylor for The Independent wrote, "Maggie Smith has to be seen to be believed. The sudden subsidings into wretched senile tears; the frustrated, dismissive flappings of her arm as her mind gropes impotently for a mislaid fact; the comic cunning with which she tries to cover over her patches of blankness; the beadily aggressive suspicion and the moments of alert cackling triumph – Smith's performance which, at the moment, is firmly on the right side of caricature, captures all this and more."  She received her record fifth Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Actress for her performance [64]. Smith acted in the film adaptation of The Secret Garden (1993) directed by Agnieszka Holland. The film was a critical success and Smith in particular was praised for her performance as Mrs. Medlock earning a British Academy Film Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

Matt Wolf of Variety wrote, "This actress  [Smith] continues to get laughs where no one else ever would ... but she can be as revealing when quiet: admitting, sad-eyed, that 'time happens' or sending the audience out for the first intermission on a note of doomy suspense."  In 1999 she gained critical acclaim for her performance as Miss Mary Shepherd in Alan Bennett's drama The Lady in the Van [69]. For her performance, she received her sixth Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress nomination. That same year, Smith starred in the BBC television adaptation of the Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield alongside Daniel Radcliffe.

"He  [Rickman] was such a terrific actor, and that was such a terrific character that he played, and it was a joy to be with him. We used to laugh together because we ran out of reaction shots. They were always – when everything had been done and the children were finished, they would turn the camera around and we'd have to do various reaction shots of amazement or sadness and things. And we used to say we'd got to about number 200-and-something and we'd run out of knowing what to do when the camera came around on us. But he was a joy." [73]. In 2001, Smith appeared in the British ensemble murder mystery Gosford Park, which was directed by Robert Altman.

Smith was a vice-president of the Chichester Cinema at New Park  and a vice-president of the Royal Theatrical Fund, which provides support for members of the entertainment profession who are unable to work due to illness, injury or infirmity [151] [152]. On 27 November 2012, Smith contributed a drawing of her own hand to the 2012 Celebrity Paw Auction, to raise funds for Cats Protection. In May 2013, Smith contributed a gnome which she had decorated, for an auction to raise money for the Royal Horticultural Society Campaign for School Gardening [155]. In November 2020, Smith joined Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench, Derek Jacobi and Ian McKellen for a conversation on Zoom entitled For One Knight Only, for the charity Acting for Others. Branagh described the group as "the greatest quartet of Shakespearean actors on the planet" as they talked about the highs and lows of their careers. In April 2021, Smith appeared in a streaming event alongside Kathleen Turner [157]. The event was in support of The Royal Theatrical Fund. 

## Death and reactions

Smith died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, on 27 September 2024, aged 89. King Charles III released a statement: "As the curtain comes down on a national treasure, we join all those around the world in remembering with the fondest admiration and affection her many great performances, and her warmth and wit that shone through both on and off the stage."  She was praised by the UK's prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, who likewise described Smith as a "national treasure" [159] [160]. Figures in the entertainment industry who paid tribute to Smith included her Sister Act co-star Whoopi Goldberg, who described her as "a great woman and a brilliant actress. I still can't believe I was lucky enough to work with the 'one-of-a-kind'."  Her Harry Potter co-star Daniel Radcliffe, released a statement reading, in part: "I will always consider myself amazingly lucky to have been able to work with her .. [162]. the word legend is overused but if it applies to anyone in our industry then it applies to her."  Another Harry Potter co-star, Emma Watson, released a statement reading, in part: "She was real, honest, funny and self-honouring .. [163]. Thank you for all of your kindness. I'll miss you."  Her Gosford Park co-star Dame Helen Mirren compared Smith to Queen Elizabeth II, saying: "Like the Queen she has been a part of my life since I was a student and she was an icon even then", adding that "she was one of the greatest actresses of the past century" [164]. Others who paid tribute to Smith included the Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling; the Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes; actors such as Rupert Grint, Bonnie Wright, Hugh Bonneville, Michelle Dockery, Viola Davis, Saoirse Ronan, Kristin Scott Thomas, Harriet Walter, Miriam Margolyes, Mia Farrow and Rob Lowe; and musician Paul McCartney. On 1 October theatres across the West End of London, dimmed their lights for two minutes to mark Smith's death [166]. It was announced that the lights would be dimmed across Broadway theatres as well in honour of her memory [167]. Her funeral took place in a private service on 4 November at Mortlake Crematorium in Richmond, south west London [168].
