2024_NHL_entry_draft

The 2024 NHL entry draft was the 62nd NHL entry draft. The draft was held on June 28–29, 2024, at the Sphere in Las Vegas. As per their April 2024 agreement, all draft rights held by the deactivated Arizona Coyotes franchise were transferred to the new Utah Hockey Club. The San Jose Sharks held the first overall pick for the first time in franchise history. The first three selections were Macklin Celebrini going to the San Jose Sharks, Artyom Levshunov being selected by the Chicago Blackhawks, and Beckett Sennecke being picked by the Anaheim Ducks.

# Eligibility

Ice hockey players born between January 1, 2004, and September 15, 2006, were eligible for selection in the 2024 NHL entry draft. Additionally, un-drafted, non-North American players born in 2003 were eligible for the draft; and those players who were drafted in the 2022 NHL entry draft, but not signed by an NHL team and who were born after June 30, 2004, were also eligible to re-enter the draft. 

# Draft lottery

Since the 2012–13 NHL season, all teams not qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs have a "weighted" chance at winning the first overall selection. Beginning with the 2014–15 NHL season, the NHL changed the weighting system that was used in previous years [4]. Under the new system, the odds of winning the draft lottery for the four lowest finishing teams in the league decreased, while the odds for the other non-playoff teams increased. As the league reduced the number of lottery drawings before the 2021–22 season, this resulted in two lotteries being held instead of three, and since the 2022 draft lottery, the teams winning one of the two drawings are allowed to move up a maximum of ten spots in the draft order and a team is only allowed to win the lottery twice in a five-year period [5]. The San Jose Sharks and Chicago Blackhawks won the two draft lotteries that were held on May 7, 2024. No change in the draft order occurred after the results of the lottery for the first time since 2010 [7]. With their second lottery win in two seasons, the Chicago Blackhawks will not be eligible to win the draft lottery again until 2028 [8].
