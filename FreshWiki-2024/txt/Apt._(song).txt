Apt._(song)

"Apt." (abbreviation for "Apartment") is a song by New Zealand and South Korean singer Rosé and American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars. It was released through The Black Label and Atlantic Records on 18 October 2024, as the lead single from Rosé's debut studio album, Rosie (2024). "Apt." marked Rosé's first solo single in three years and her first release since departing from YG Entertainment and Interscope Records in 2023. The song was written and composed by various contributors, including Rosé and Mars, and includes elements from the 1982 tune "Mickey" by Toni Basil. It is an up-tempo pop, pop rock, pop-punk, and new wave track, featuring indie rock and electropop influences. Inspired by a South Korean drinking game, the song's chorus is built around the game's rhythmic chant of apateu (Korean: 아파트; lit. apartment; pronounced [a̠pʰa̠tʰɯ]).
Critics lauded "Apt." for its catchy production, broad cross-cultural appeal, and its role in promoting Korean culture worldwide. It was a commercial success and spent eleven weeks atop the Billboard Global 200, becoming Rosé and Mars' second number-one single each and the longest-running number-one song of 2024. In South Korea, it peaked at number one on the Circle Digital Chart for ten weeks. "Apt." was the first song by a K-pop female soloist to top Australia's ARIA Singles Chart and the first Western song to top the Billboard Japan Hot 100 in over a decade. The song also topped the charts in over thirty other countries, including Austria, Germany, Indonesia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Switzerland. It entered the top five on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, the first song by a K-pop female soloist to do so on either.
An accompanying music video was directed by Mars and Daniel Ramos and premiered on Rosé's YouTube channel simultaneously with the single's release. The video featured Rosé and Mars as a garage band with matching black leather jackets in a pink-coloured set. It broke a number of viewership records on YouTube, becoming the fastest video by a K-pop act to reach 500 million views on the platform. Rosé promoted "Apt." with performances on The Seasons: Lee Young-ji's Rainbow, BBC Radio 1's Christmas Live Lounge 2024, and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. She performed the song with Mars at the 2024 MAMA Awards, where they received the Global Sensation award.

# Background and promotion

On 29 December 2023, Rosé announced her departure from YG Entertainment to its associate company The Black Label for her solo work, while remaining with YG to continue her activities as a member of Blackpink. Prior to her departure, Rosé released her debut solo single album, R, in March 2021, featuring the songs "On the Ground" and "Gone". These releases garnered commercial success. In August 2024, Rosé was seen attending a concert of Bruno Mars in Los Angeles, later sharing a picture of her wearing a shirt with Mars on it. In September, Rosé announced via her social media that she signed a new global solo deal with Atlantic Records [4]. On 16 October, Rosé posted a polaroid picture of her sitting next to Mars and revealed that she taught him a Korean drinking game [3]. Mars also shared an Instagram story of Rosé supposedly trying to kiss him that night, promoting a possible upcoming release [5]. On 17 October, Rosé announced the release of the single on her social media, a day ahead of the release. An accompanying artwork was revealed alongside the announcement, featuring a black-and-white rose-tinted photo of Mars behind a drum set and Rosé lying in front of the set with a black leather jacket and skirt on [7]. The news of the release arrived a few weeks after the announcement of Rosé's debut studio album Rosie, slated for release on 6 December 2024 [8]. 

# Composition and lyrics

"Apt." was written by Rosé, Amy Allen, Brody Brown, Philip Lawrence, Theron Thomas of R. City, Rogét Chahayed, Omer Fedi, Cirkut, and Mars, while being produced by the latter four; additional writing credits go to Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman for the interpolation of Toni Basil's 1982 single "Mickey". "Apt." has been described as a pop,  pop-punk,  pop rock,  and new wave track,  featuring indie rock and electropop elements [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]. It opens with a rap verse, transitions to a "melodious" pre-chorus, and builds to an energetic chorus influenced by the Apartment game chant [11]. Inspired by a popular South Korean drinking game named "Apartment", from which the title of the song is also derived, the track employs the game's rhythmic chant of apateu (Korean: 아파트; lit. apartment) to create a "playful" and "addictive" chorus. In an interview with Vogue, Rosé revealed that she was initially "kind of freaked out" how people would react to a song about a drinking game [11] [13]. Moreover, Rosé "asked her team to delete the song from their phones", only to find out "that they were already obsessed with it" [17] [11]. She later proposed a collaboration to Mars and pitched him three songs: "Number One Girl", "3am", and "Apt.", with the last track being her preferred choice [11]. After listening to the songs, Mars asked what the title of "APT." meant, prompting Rosé to explain that the track was based on a Korean drinking game [18] [19]. Rosé also expressed that she had "never thought that  [the collaboration] would happen" and was "very excited" to work with Mars [18]. On 8 November, Rosé shared a behind-the-scenes video on Instagram, celebrating a year since writing and recording "Apt." on 7 November 2023 [18]. 

# Critical reception

"Apt." received widespread acclaim from music critics and fans alike. It has been included in multiple critics' year-end lists. Recognised as a cultural phenomenon, the track was acknowledged by Forbes as the most acclaimed K-pop song of 2024. NME's Rhian Daly awarded "Apt." five out of five stars, calling it "a luminous banger that fizzes with playful energy, from its stomping pop-rock beat to its addictive chanted chorus."  Irene Kim of Vogue also praised the track, highlighting the vocal harmony between Rosé and Bruno Mars and dubbing it "a pop-punk delight" that "will have fans chanting along" [21] [13]. Paper included "Apt." in its weekly new songs roundup, describing it as a "cheeky, rollicking pop-rock track" accompanied by an "irrepressibly fun, Ting Tings-y video" [11]. Billboard featured the song on its weekly must-hears list, lauding it as "a slick pop confection full of clap-along refrains" [22]. South Korean critics echoed the praise, noting the song's catchy melody and inventive concept. Music critic Jeong Min-jae highlighted the repetitive, chant-like chorus of "Apt", noting its appeal to foreign listeners for its easy pronunciation and rhythmic fun. Jeong emphasised the song's addictiveness and the impact of its catchy chorus, adding that its pop-punk rock vibe aligns well with current music trends. He suggested this could help elevate K-pop's musical credibility beyond just its industry appeal. Park Seon-min, a pop culture critic and professor at Kyung Hee University, attributes the international popularity of "Apt.", to its catchy lyrics, drinking game theme, and star appeal [24]. He notes the song’s addictive melody, vibrant visuals, and relatable concept, which make it engaging and easy for audiences to enjoy. Meanwhile, popular music critic Jeong Won-seok commented that the song itself doesn't feel "fresh", as it brings to mind tracks like "Mickey" and the Ting Tings' "That's Not My Name" [25]. However, he praised it for introducing a new style rarely seen in recent K-pop, calling it a "well-made pop song" that stands apart from the usual English-language pop hits. 

## Cultural analysis

Critic Lim Hee-yoon noted that the song turns everyday Korean language into a global meme, much like Psy's "Gentleman" or Suga's "Daechwita", using unique pronunciations uncommon in the West. Lim also compared it to Psy's "Hangover" with Snoop Dogg, emphasising its reflection of Korean artists' global influence [24]. He described the song as having a strong hook, an '80s vibe, and a melodic progression reminiscent of modern band music. Kim Do-heon, a pop music critic, emphasised the appeal of incorporating a drinking game into the track and observed that, while Rosé usually exudes "high-end" charisma, this collaboration reveals a more approachable and upbeat side, resonating well with fans [10]. Music critic Lim Jin-mo praised the song for its addictive quality, a key element in pop music, and noted how the song combines fun aspects of Korean culture with Bruno Mars' global appeal. He described it as a successful "glocal" fusion—a word combining global and local influences. On YTN Radio, pop music critic Lee Dae-hwa praised the song's catchy hook, likening it to addictive "hook songs" from the past, such as Son Dam-bi's "Crazy" and Girls' Generation's "Gee" [27]. He emphasised that short, repetitive hooks are essential in popular music, particularly in dance tracks. The song's relatable elements and the inclusion of a Korean drinking game in the music video have sparked international interest in Korean culture. Dae-hwa also compared "Apt." to Psy's "Gangnam Style", noting that while both use cultural elements for viral appeal, "Apt." stands out for its catchy melody and contemporary relevance. Another pop culture critic Jeong Deok-hyeon commented that K-pop is viewed as a subculture leader internationally, rather than mainstream, and praised "Apt." for its strategic use of Korean elements, like the repeated word "apartment" and a music video scene of Mars waving the South Korean flag, Taegeukgi, which resonates with K-pop fans' sense of "minority sentiment" triumphing. Another critic, Kim Kyo-seok, observed that "Apt." is consumed more as meme-driven short-form content, reflecting today’s "age of memes" [27]. He added that Mars waving the Taegeukgi and shouting "geonbae" (cheers) is a powerful symbol of Korean culture's mainstream global appeal. Professor Seo Kyung-deok of Sungshin Women's University praised "Apt." for promoting Korean culture globally. He highlighted moments in the music video, like Mars shouting "geonbae" and Rosé singing, and noted that Korean items like somaek, "one of Korea's representative drinking cultures, is being widely introduced to people around the world," boosting international interest in Korean culture. Similarly, cultural critic Chung Deok-hyun highlighted "Apt." as a blends Korean culture and pop music, with American producers adding global appeal [30] [31]. He sees it as a milestone for K-pop, showing how artists like Rosé can connect K-pop with the global music market. Japanese author and former Tokyo University of Foreign Studies professor Hideki Noma highlighted the unique appeal of the song, calling it a "victory of plurilingualism" for its blend of English, Korean, Western pop, and Korean game slogans. In an interview with The Hankook Ilbo, he praised how the song enhances language appeal by mixing English and Korean without relying on traditional storytelling. He also noted that the repeated Korean aspirated sounds "ㅍ" (p) and "ㅌ" (t) add rhythm and charm to the word "apartment", allowing non-Korean speakers to appreciate its sound "while leaving the meaning of the word a little mystery". 

# Impact

"Apt." was named the Song of the Year by South Korean research company Gallup Korea's annual public survey conducted in 2024 among respondents under the age of 40.

The song has also boosted HiteJinro's stock by 6% to 21,200 won, with trading volume exceeding 1 million shares [45] [46] [47]. Investors are optimistic about further gains, with a company official noting that somaek could become a global topic due to Rosé's influence. He remarked, "Rosé has turned Korea's play culture into music, showing how to make somaek, which we hope will spark international interest in Korean soju".

Additionally, YG Plus stock rose 157.8% over six trading days, benefiting as it handles distribution for Rosé's solo work under The Black Label [48].
