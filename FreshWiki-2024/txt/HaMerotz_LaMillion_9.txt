HaMerotz_LaMillion_9

HaMerotz LaMillion 9, also known as HaMerotz LaMillion 2024, is the ninth season of HaMerotz LaMillion (Hebrew: המירוץ למיליון, lit. The Race to the Million), an Israeli reality competition show based on the American series The Amazing Race, and the first installment of Channel 12's iteration of the show. Hosted by Yehuda Levi, replacing Ron Shahar who hosted the previous seasons of the show, it featured thirteen teams of two, each with a pre-existing relationship, in a race around the world to win ₪1,000,000. This season visited four continents and twelve countries and traveled over 59,566 kilometres (37,013 mi) during twelve legs. Starting in Mýrdalshreppur, racers travelled through Iceland, Spain, Gibraltar, Morocco, Senegal, Azerbaijan, Austria, Germany, Mongolia, South Korea, Vietnam, and New Zealand before finishing in Gibbston. New twists introduced in this season include Partner Swap. Elements of the show that returned for this season include the Fast Forward and the no-rest leg. The season was set to premiere in early 2024, although the premiere date was delayed by the Israel-Hamas war. The season premiered on 1 July 2024 on Channel 12 and concluded on 25 September 2024.
Sisters Lee and Anne Avrahami were the winners of this season, while niece and uncle Inbar Ben Atia and Avishai Regev finished in second place, and married parents Lior Dabach and Sapir Avisror finished in third place.

# Production

## Development and filming

During finale press for the previous season, Ron Shahar said that due to the COVID-19 pandemic production for a subsequent season would happen after the countries to which the show would visit had sufficient vaccinated populations. Shahar reiterated that filming for a new season would happen as soon as possible in an interview after his elimination from The Singer in the Mask a year later [1]. In October 2022, Channel 13 announced that it would be producing a local version of Peking Express instead of new seasons of HaMerotz LaMillion due to high production costs,   with Peking Express estimated to cost 1.1 million shekels per episode rather than 1.5 million shekels for each episode of HaMerotz LaMillion [2] [3] [4]. On 11 November 2022, Channel 12 announced that it had acquired the rights to HaMerotz LaMillion and would be filming a new season in 2023. On 12 March 2023, Yehuda Levi was announced as the new host of HaMerotz LaMillion [6]. Filming began in May 2023 [7]. On 14 May 2023, racers were spotted in Málaga, Spain [8] [9]. On 9 June, filming occurred in Queenstown, New Zealand [10]. After 35 days, filming concluded in mid-June [11]. Promotion material released before the season began claimed that this season visited more countries that any other season of The Amazing Race globally [12]. This season also includes first-time visits to Iceland, the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, the Arab world with Morocco, Senegal, Azerbaijan, Austria, Germany, and Mongolia. [13].
