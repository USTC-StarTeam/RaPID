2024_World_Snooker_Championship

The 2024 World Snooker Championship was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 20 April to 6 May 2024. Organised by the World Snooker Tour, it was the 17th and final ranking event of the 2023‍–‍24 season. The title sponsor was car retailer Cazoo, so the tournament was promoted as the 2024 Cazoo World Snooker Championship.
Staged at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, the tournament was the 48th consecutive World Snooker Championship to be held at the venue, where it has taken place annually since 1977. The qualifying rounds were played from 8 to 17 April at the English Institute of Sport, also in Sheffield. The event was broadcast domestically in the United Kingdom by the BBC, Eurosport and Discovery+, and by various other broadcasters worldwide. The winner received £500,000 from a total prize fund of £2,395,000.
Kyren Wilson won the event, defeating qualifier Jak Jones 18‍–‍14 in the final to become the 28th snooker world champion. On his way to the final, Wilson eliminated Dominic Dale, Joe O'Connor, John Higgins, and David Gilbert in the earlier rounds of the tournament.
The defending champion, Luca Brecel, who had defeated Mark Selby in the 2023 final, lost in the first round to Gilbert. Unable to defend his first world title at the venue, Brecel became the 19th player to experience the Crucible curse. There were 63 century breaks compiled in the main stage of the tournament, with a further 122 recorded in the qualifying rounds. Noppon Saengkham made a maximum break in the third round of qualifying.

# Background

The first World Snooker Championship concluded in 1927. It became an annual knockout tournament in 1969, which is considered the beginning of the championship's "modern era" [1] [2]. The 1977 tournament was the first to be staged at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, which has hosted every subsequent iteration [3] [4]. The 2024 event was organised by the World Snooker Tour. The title sponsor was car retailer Cazoo, for the second time, so it was promoted as the 2024 Cazoo World Snooker Championship. It was the 48th consecutive year that the tournament was held at the Crucible and the 56th successive year that the World Championship had been contested through the modern knockout format [7]. Luca Brecel was the defending champion, having defeated Mark Selby 18‍–‍15 in the 2023 final to win his first world title. At the 2024 event, he attempted to overcome the Crucible curse, which has allegedly prevented any first‑time winner from retaining the title since the tournament moved to the Crucible in 1977 [10]. 

## Format

Qualifying took place from 8 to 17 April 2024 at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield, England. A total of 128 players competed over four qualifying rounds for 16 places in the main stage [12]. The players included professionals outside the top 16 of the snooker world rankings and 18 leading amateur players. Several professional players that did not enter the qualifying rounds were replaced by amateurs based on the 2023 Q School Order of Merit. The main stage of the championship was held from 20 April to 6 May at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. The top 16 players in the world rankings were seeded per their standing following the 2024 Tour Championship and were drawn randomly against the 16 successful qualifiers in the first round [14]. The draw was broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live on 18 April. All qualifying matches and first‑round matches were played as the best of 19 frames over two sessions. Second‑round matches and quarter‑finals were the best of 25 frames, played over three sessions [12]. Semi‑finals were the best of 33 frames and the final was the best of 35 frames, all three matches played over four sessions. 

## Broadcasters

The qualifying matches were broadcast by Discovery+ in Europe (including the United Kingdom and Ireland); Huya in China; and Matchroom.live in all other territories. Round four of qualifying, called "Judgement Day", was also streamed on World Snooker Tour's YouTube and Facebook pages. The main stages of the event were broadcast by the BBC in the United Kingdom; Discovery+ and Eurosport in Europe (including the United Kingdom and Ireland); CCTV-5, Migu, Youku, and Huya in mainland China; DAZN in the United States and Brazil; Now TV in Hong Kong; Astro SuperSport in Malaysia and Brunei; TrueVisions in Thailand; Sportcast in Taiwan; Premier Sports Network in the Philippines; Fastsports in Pakistan; and Matchroom.live in all other territories. 

## Prize fund

The winner of the event received £500,000 from a total prize fund of £2,395,000. The breakdown of prize money is shown below: [19]. A bonus of £40,000 was offered for a maximum break made at the Crucible and £10,000 for a maximum made in the qualifying rounds. These bonuses were in addition to the £15,000 highest‑break prize and would be shared in the case of multiple maximums. An additional bonus of £147,000 was offered for any player making two maximum breaks during the season's Triple Crown events [20]. The latter bonus could be won up to three times, including multiple times by the same player, e.g [21]. if one player made six maximums in Triple Crown events, they would win the bonus three times, for a total prize of £441,000. Prior to the 2024 World Championship, three players had already made maximums that counted toward this bonus—Xu Si made a maximum in the 2023 UK Championship qualifying rounds,  and Ding Junhui and Mark Allen each made one at the 2024 Masters [20] [22]. Xu was defeated by Alfie Burden in qualifying, Ding was beaten by Jack Lisowski in the first round, and Allen was defeated by John Higgins in the second round. [23] [24]. 

# Summary

## Qualifying

Qualifying was held from 8 to 17 April at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield. The seven‑time champion Stephen Hendry chose not to enter. He had previously opted not to enter the 2022 event,  and lost in the first qualifying round at the 2023 event [25] [26]. Martin Gould withdrew from the tournament for health reasons, having not played professionally since December 2023; his opponent, six‑time runner‑up Jimmy White, received a walkover [27]. Ending the season at 129th and 81st place, respectively, in the world rankings, Hendry and Gould were both set to be relegated from the professional tour,  but Gould was later given a 12‑month extension on medical grounds [28] [29] [30]. 

### First qualification round

The first qualifying round took place from 8 to 10 April and featured players ranked 81st to 112th against players ranked 113th and below, plus selected amateurs, including three players who had received two‑year tour cards, playing as professionals for the first time beginning in the 2024‍–‍25 season. Liam Davies won the 2024 EBSA European Under‑21 Championship to earn his tour card [13] [12]. He defeated Ryan Thomerson 10‍–‍3 [32]. Cheung Ka Wai, aged 25, and Bulcsú Révész, aged 17, won the 2024 WSF Open Championship and the 2024 WSF World Junior Championship, respectively, for their tour cards [33].

Bai Yulu had won the 2024 World Women's Championship to earn a two‑year tour card beginning in the 2024‍–‍25 season [29]. She played Jenson Kendrick, who led 6‍–‍2 after the first session [43]. Bai narrowed her deficit to two frames at 7‍–‍9 and forced a re‑spotted black in the 17th frame after acquiring foul points from a snooker, but Kendrick potted the black to win 10‍–‍7. Reanne Evans, the 12‑time Women's World Champion, was whitewashed 10‍–‍0 by Oliver Brown,  while Baipat Siripaporn, the 2023 Women's World Champion, lost 1‍–‍10 to Marco Fu, a former two‑time World semi‑finalist [33] [36].

### Second qualification round

The second qualifying round took place from 10 to 13 April and featured players ranked 49th to 80th against the winners of the first qualification round. Two former winners started in the second qualification round [12]. The 1997 champion Ken Doherty was defeated by Marco Fu,  and the 2006 winner Graeme Dott defeated Mostafa Dorgham [44]. Six‑time runner‑up Jimmy White was defeated by Liu Hongyu 3‍–‍10. All five remaining amateur players lost in the second qualification round.

### Third qualification round

The third qualifying round took place from 13 to 15 April and featured players ranked 17th to 48th against the winners of the second qualification round. Jack Lisowski entered in the third qualifying round, having been an automatic qualifier every year since 2018 [12]. He made four century breaks as he defeated Liu Hongyu 10‍–‍4. Former finalist Matthew Stevens defeated Jimmy Robertson 10‍–‍6 [46]. Anthony McGill lost 5‍–‍10 to He Guoqiang, having successfully qualified for the main event in each of the last nine seasons [46]. Jenson Kendrick, who entered the first round of qualifying, defeated Jordan Brown, needing to qualify for the main stage to remain as a professional [46] [47]. Noppon Saengkham, playing Andy Hicks, made a maximum break in the tenth frame and went 7‍–‍3 ahead, later winning 10‍–‍5. Stuart Bingham, who had appeared at the main stage every year since 2010, trailed Stuart Carrington 3‍–‍7 but recovered to win 10‍–‍9 [48] [49]. 

### Fourth qualification round

The fourth and final qualifying round took place on 16 and 17 April. Former winner Neil Robertson failed to qualify for the main stage for the first time in 20 years, after losing in a deciding frame to Jamie Jones [12]. Si Jiahui, who reached the semi‑final in 2023, lost the first four frames to Wu Yize but then won ten frames in a row to gain a 10‍–‍4 victory [52] [53]. Dominic Dale qualified for the event for the first time since 2014 as he defeated He Guoqiang [53]. At 52 years old, Dale was the oldest qualifier since Steve Davis in the 2010 event. He credited his upturn in form to his new French girlfriend [54]. Mark Davis lost in a deciding frame in the final round for a second successive year [54]. He lost 9‍–‍10 to Ricky Walden. The 17th seed Jack Lisowski defeated Matthew Stevens 10‍–‍3, making six century breaks [55] [54]. Only three low‑ranked players progressed to the fourth round from the first round. Louis Heathcote (ranked 100th) was defeated 10‍–‍8 by Stuart Bingham. Heathcote was ahead 8‍–‍7 but missed a pot on the pink that would have opened up a two-frame lead. Jenson Kendrick (ranked 103rd) lost his tour card following a 7‍–‍10 loss to Lyu Haotian [56]. Jiang Jun (ranked 110th) was defeated by Hossein Vafaei 5‍–‍10 in the final qualifying round [56]. Joe O'Connor was the only debutant to qualify for the main stage of the event [56]. He led 9‍–‍8 before winning the final frame of the match, which lasted over 1 hour and 50 minutes, the second-longest frame ever played. 

## Main stage

The draw for the last 32 was made on 18 April on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sport with Rob Walker and Mark Allen. On the evening of 19 April, Hendry and comedian Mark Watson hosted a live edition of the official World Snooker Tour podcast Snooker Club at the Crucible Theatre, where they were joined by Judd Trump and comedian Jon Richardson [59] [60]. 

### First round

The first round took place from 20 to 25 April, as the best of 19 frames was played over two sessions. Of the sixteen seeded players, eight were defeated in the opening round [14]. Brecel, the defending champion and top seed, met 2019 semi‑finalist David Gilbert in the opening match. Between the two, they made seven breaks above 70 in nine frames and Brecel led 6‍–‍3 [62]. Brecel moved to 9‍–‍6 ahead but was unable to win the match as he was defeated in a deciding frame [63]. Post match, Brecel commented that he had been unwell and had not liked the spotlight of being defending champion,  but he praised Gilbert's performance [63] [64]. The highest ranked qualifier, Jack Lisowski, defeated Ding Junhui in a deciding frame [65] [62]. Jak Jones and Zhang Anda's first session was finished after only playing seven of the nine frames due to slow play [66]. Leading 5‍–‍2, Jones gained a 10‍–‍4 victory in the second session. Despite trailing 4‍–‍5 after the first session, Stephen Maguire defeated 9th seed Ali Carter 10‍–‍7 [67] [68]. Fifth seed and four‑time champion Mark Selby lost 6‍–‍10 to debutant Joe O'Connor [69]. Selby stated that he was going to re‑evaluate retirement after the championship. Qualifier Stuart Bingham defeated Gary Wilson 10‍–‍5 [70] [71]. Wilson commented that his form had been "like putting myself through torture". Si Jiahui led sixth seed Mark Williams 8‍–‍5, but Williams tied the score at 9‍–‍9 [72]. Si made a break of 77 to win the match. He commented that he did not feel the pressure, as he was the challenger to Williams. Ryan Day defeated 15th seed Barry Hawkins 10‍–‍8 [73] [74]. Hawkins won six frames in a row to lead 8‍–‍5 before Day won the next five to win the match [75]. The third seed Judd Trump led Hossein Vafaei 6‍–‍3 after the first session, despite being significantly behind on points in six of the frames. Trump gained a 10‍–‍5 victory in the second session [62]. Following the loss, Vafaei commented that the arena "smelled" and that the practice tables were "like playing in a garage" [68]. Tom Ford, who was playing as a seeded player for the first time, defeated Ricky Walden 10‍–‍6 [77]. Ford had previously lost all four of his matches at the event. Shaun Murphy won five frames in a row as he defeated Lyu Haotian 10‍–‍5 [78]. Murphy, who had lost his previous two first round World Championship matches, called the result "rewarding" [79]. Robert Milkins survived a deciding frame as he defeated Pang Junxu 10‍–‍9 [73]. Dominic Dale made a break of 120 in the only frame he won, as he played Kyren Wilson [80]. Wilson completed a 10‍–‍1 victory, making a half‑century or better in nine frames. Seven‑time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan also gained a 10‍–‍1 victory as he defeated Jackson Page [81]. Four‑time winner John Higgins trailed Jamie Jones 1‍–‍3 but eventually won 10‍–‍6 [82]. World number three Mark Allen gained a 10‍–‍6 victory over Robbie Williams [83]. 

### Second round

The second round took place from 25 to 29 April, as the best of 25 frames was played over three sessions. Trailing 4‍–‍7 against David Gilbert, Milkins threw his cue stick to the ground in frustration after missing a pot [14]. Gilbert won the remaining frames of the match to win 13‍–‍4 [85]. Trump gained an early lead against Tom Ford, winning four frames in a row, from 2‍–‍2 to 6‍–‍2 [86] [87]. He made seven breaks of above 50 to lead 11‍–‍5 after the second session. Trump gained a 13‍–‍7 victory in the third session. Ford commented "You can get away with one bad session here, but not two". Jak Jones opened a 6‍–‍2 lead over Si Jiahui after the first session, but the lead was reduced to two frames, as he led 9‍–‍7 after the second session [88] [89]. Jones gained a 13‍–‍9 victory in the final session. In progressing to the quarter‑finals, he was the first player in 25 years (since Matthew Stevens in 1998 and 1999) to reach the quarter‑finals in his first two World Championship appearances. Murphy and Maguire met in the second round of the event, having been "rivals since children" [90]. In winning a couple of frames, Murphy celebrated with a fist bump. However, when winning the frame to lead 10‍–‍6, Maguire punched the table and celebrated wildly and later went on to win the match 13‍–‍9. Maguire commented after the match that his attention had been strengthened after seeing Murphy celebrate the previous frame wins. O'Sullivan played Ryan Day, who had not defeated O'Sullivan in the previous 13 years. Leading 10‍–‍6 after the second session, O'Sullivan won three out of four frames to complete a 13‍–‍7 victory. Kyren Wilson led O'Connor 10‍–‍6 after the second session of their match and won three straight frames to win 13‍–‍6 [93]. Bingham led Lisowski 9‍–‍7 going into the final session [94] [93] [95]. Lisowski missed a frame ball shot on the pink ball to tie the match at 10‍–‍10 but made breaks of 84 and 124 to tie the score at 11‍–‍11. Lisowski missed another pot on the pink in frame 23, with Bingham making a clearance to win the frame and later gaining a 13‍–‍11 victory [96]. John Higgins met Mark Allen in a second‑round tie, where Higgins was required to win to remain in the top 16 in the snooker world rankings [97]. They had met five times previously in the season, with Higgins winning three. The pair were tied at 4‍–‍4 after the first session,  but Allen opened up a two‑frame lead after the second session [98]. Allen won the first frame of the final session, but Higgins won the next three to tie the score at 10‍–‍10. Allen took the lead twice, but Higgins tied the match again at 12‍–‍12. With Allen leading by 62 points, Higgins made a double, followed by a 71 break to win the match 13‍–‍12. After the match, Higgins called the break in the deciding frame "one of my best",  and commented, "I'm over the moon [99] [100] [96]. I think it will hit me later that it was a special clearance. I'm proud of myself."  Allen commented, "I had more than enough chances to win it and credit to John  [Higgins], he does what John does and clears up in the deciding frame." [101] [102]. 

### Quarter-finals

The quarter-finals took place from 30 April to 1 May, as the best of 25 frames was played over three sessions. For the first time since 1992, half of the quarter‑finalists were qualifiers [14]. Qualifier Jak Jones won three of the first opening four frames and led 4‍–‍3 before Trump won frame eight, despite needing a snooker [97]. Jones won the first two frames of the second session, the second of which lasted over 55 minutes [103]. Trump tied the score at 7‍–‍7 and won frame 15 to lead before a 115 break by Jones in the final frame of the session tied the score with one session left to play. Jones won the opening frame on the resumption but went in‑off in the second, allowing Trump to tie the match 9‍–‍9 [103]. Trump, however, didn't win another frame and Jones defeated Trump 13‍–‍9. Jones commented, "I feel good and pleased to get through [104]. I thought Judd  [Trump] struggled. He started with a century and it kind of motivated me." Trump agreed, saying "Playing like that, he did me a favour because I'd have lost 17‍–‍0  [in the next round]." [105]. Gilbert opened up a 7‍–‍1 lead in his match against Maguire in the first session. Gilbert won the first of the second session to lead by seven frames and was ahead 9‍–‍2 [106]. Maguire, however, won four of the remaining five frames of the session to trail by only four frames. Maguire won three of the first four frames of the third session, as Gilbert led 11‍–‍8, but Gilbert won the remaining frames of the match to win 13‍–‍8 [107]. In the final frame, despite requiring only one snooker, Maguire conceded the match. Gilbert commented afterwards that he was "relieved" and would "buy  [Maguire] a pint" because of his withdrawal. Maguire commented that he had not had much luck during the match and that playing on would be "a waste of time". Kyren Wilson had lost all of his previous matches against John Higgins at the World Championship, including a semi‑final loss in 2018 and a 2‍–‍13 loss in the second round in 2023. Wilson won the first four frames of the match and was ahead 5‍–‍1, but Higgins won the final two frames of the first session to trail by two frames [108] [109]. Wilson also took a larger lead as he took four of the next five frames to lead 9‍–‍4, but Higgins won the remaining three frames to trail by only two frames [110] [111]. Higgins later commented that he felt like he had "won the lottery" at getting the score to that point. Higgins won the first frame of the third session to trail by one frame, but Wilson won the next four frames to win the match 13‍–‍8 [112]. Wilson stated, "To come off the back of absolute annihilation from John here last year, I had to put that to one side." Higgins commented that "the best man won" and "I hope  [Wilson] is holding the trophy aloft with his son on Bank Holiday Monday." He also commented that he "didn't want that to be the last I play at the Crucible."  Despite the loss, in making the quarter‑finals, Higgins was able to retain his top‑16 status in the World Rankings [113] [112]. After eleven frames, O'Sullivan led Bingham 6‍–‍5. In the twelfth frame, a situation occurred where the referee, Desislava Bozhilova, was unable to properly re‑spot the black ball after it was potted. This left O'Sullivan with a relatively simple next red. He refused to take the red and instead played a safety shot, which arguably cost him the frame. Writing in The Guardian, Simon Hattenstone said, "It was incredible. This was a shot that both defined and transcended sport. It was everything we'd learned about sportsmanship at school (if we had decent teachers). But it was also about the best of humanity – morality, bravery, sacrifice and sheer bloody goodness."  Resuming at 8‍–‍8 against Bingham, O'Sullivan made 136 before Bingham levelled with a 63 [115]. Bingham won four of the next five frames to win the match 13‍–‍10. The win was only his fourth against O'Sullivan in 22 meetings. An emotional Bingham said, "I've had a little cry in the back there...I don't know how I held myself together" [116]. 

### Semi-finals

The semi-finals took place from 2 to 4 May, as the best of 33 frames was played over four sessions. Three of the four semi‑finalists were qualifiers, for the first time since 1977 [14]. The only remaining seeded player, Kyren Wilson, played David Gilbert in the first semi-final [112]. The pair tied their opening session at 4‍–‍4, with Gilbert making breaks of 91 and 104. In the eighth frame, Wilson attempted a maximum break but missed a pot on 88 [118]. During the break, Wilson said, "thank god Mark Selby is out", alluding to the fact he had made a maximum the previous year but split the prize money with Selby. The pair's second session ended at 8‍–‍8 and they both made half-century breaks in the third session to tie again at 9‍–‍9 [119]. Wilson then won five frames in a row, including breaks of 93, 51, and 88, before Gilbert won the final frame of the session with a break of 101. Resuming 10‍–‍14 behind, Gilbert won frame 25 with a break of 70 [120] [121]. Needing foul shots from laying snookers, Gilbert was able to get the required points but was still unable to win frame 26 [122]. Wilson won frame 27 with a break of 54 and won the next frame, after Gilbert broke down on a 49 break, to win the match 17‍–‍11. Wilson commented that he was "chuffed" having a lead after the third session and Gilbert thought he "had a bit of a shocker" and that Wilson "deserved to win" despite thinking he would win the match [123]. Jak Jones was playing in his first World Championship semi‑final, having made his Crucible debut the previous year, and Stuart Bingham was playing in his third. Bingham won all three of the opening three frames of the match but missed frame ball in the fourth as Jones recovered to 1‍–‍3. Jones also won the next two frames before Bingham won frame seven, and Jones tied the match at 4‍–‍4. Bingham made breaks of 79 and 107 to lead 6‍–‍4, but Jones won three frames to lead the match before Bingham won frame 14 [125]. After Jones won frame 15, he was placed into a snooker and missed escaping seven times. Bingham made a clearance to tie the score 8‍–‍8. Bingham won frame 17, but Jones won all of the next six frames to lead 13‍–‍9 [126]. Bingham won frame 23, but their final frame of the third session was postponed as the session ran over. Bingham won a 40‑minute 24th frame but missed a pot on the green ball in frame 25 to allow Jones to lead 14‍–‍11 [127]. Jones won the next frame with a break of 65, and Bingham won the next frame which lasted almost 45 minutes. The four frames of the mini‑session lasted almost two and a half hours. After the interval, Jones made breaks of 70, 44, and 58 to win the next two frames and the match 17‍–‍12. Despite winning, Jones commented that he had not played well, and Bingham stated that he himself "must have given eight frames away" [128].
