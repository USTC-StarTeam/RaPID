Andhra_Pradesh

Andhra Pradesh (ISO: Āndhra Pradēś, Telugu pronunciation: [aːndʱɾɐ pɾɐdeːʃ]; code: AP) is a state on the east coast of southern India. It is the seventh-largest state and the tenth-most populous in the country. Telugu is the most widely spoken language in the state, as well as its primary official language. Amaravati is the state capital, while the largest city is Visakhapatnam. Andhra Pradesh shares borders with Odisha to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the north, Karnataka to the southwest, Tamil Nadu to the south, Telangana to northwest and the Bay of Bengal to the east. It has the second-longest coastline in India at about 974 kilometres (605 mi).
Archaeological evidence suggests that Andhra Pradesh has had continuous human presence for over 247,000 years, ranging from early archaic hominins to Neolithic settlements. The earliest mention of the Andhras tribe occurs in Aitareya Brahmana (c. 800 BCE) of the Rigveda. Around 300 BCE, the Andhras living in the Godavari and Krishna river deltas were renowned for their formidable military strength—second only to the Maurya Empire in the subcontinent. The first major Andhra polity was the Satavahana dynasty (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE) which ruled over the entire Deccan Plateau and even distant areas of western and central India. They established trade relations with the Roman Empire, and their capital city Dhanyakataka was the most prosperous city in India during the 2nd century CE. After that, the major rulers included the Vishnukundinas, Eastern Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagara Empire, Qutb Shahis, and the British Raj. After Indian independence, Andhra State was bifurcated from Madras State in 1953. It was merged with Telangana, comprising Telugu-speaking areas of the former Hyderabad State, to form Andhra Pradesh in 1956. It reverted to its earlier form in 2014, when the new state of Telangana was bifurcated from it.
The Eastern Ghats separate coastal plains and peneplains. Krishna, Godavari, and Penna are the major rivers. The state has about one-third of India's limestone reserves, large deposits of baryte and granite. The population engaged in agriculture and related activities is 62.17%. Rice is the state's major food crop and staple food. The state contributes to 30% of fish production in India and has a share of 35% in total seafood exports of India. Sriharikota Range at the barrier island of Sriharikota in Tirupati district, is the primary satellite launching station of India.
Amaravati school of art, a major ancient Indian art style that influenced South Indian, Sri Lankan, and Southeast Asian art arose from this state. Kuchipudi, one of India's classical dances originated in the state. Several renowned Carnatic music composers trace their origins to the state. The state is home to a variety of pilgrimage centres and natural attractions such as Tirumala Venkateswara temple near Tirupati, and Araku valley. Tirupati Laddu, Banganapalle mangoes, Kondapalli Toys, Dharmavaram sarees, and Pootharekulu are few products produced in the state with geographical indication registration.

# Etymology

Andhras were mentioned in Aitareya Brahmana of the Rigveda (c. 800-500 BCE) as descendants of Sage Vishvamitra. Andhras were referred to as dasyus or non-aryans living on the fringes of Aryan settlements [9]. The Satavahanas, the earliest kings who ruled this region were mentioned by the names Andhra, Andhrara-jateeya, and Andhrabhrtya in the Puranic literature [10] [11]. "Andhra" is both a tribal and territorial name. The region inhabited by Andhras was called Andhradesa . 

# History

## Pre-history

Excavated stone tools from Hanumanthunipadu in Prakasam district were dated to be 2.47 lakh (247,000) years old (Middle Paleolithic). This finding means that these tools were developed by archaic hominins (pre-humans) as such tools were thought to be used by modern man migrating out of Africa about 2.10 lakh (210,000) years ago. In the absence of fossil evidence, it became a riddle to understand what happened to them. The discovery of petroglyphs, pictographs, and dolmens in Chakrala Bodu, near Boyalapalli village in the Yerragondapalem mandal area of Prakasam district indicates the presence of Neolithic-age human settlements in the region [14]. 

## Early and medieval history

Megasthenes reported in his Indica (c. 310 BCE) that Andhras were living in the Godavari and Krishna river deltas and were famous for their military strength which was second only to Mauryans in all of India. Archaeological evidence from places such as Bhattiprolu, Amaravathi, and Dharanikota suggests that the Andhra region was part of the Mauryan empire [16] [17]. After the death of Emperor Ashoka, Mauryan rule weakened around 200 BCE and was replaced by several smaller kingdoms in the Andhra region. One of the earliest examples of the Brahmi script, from Bhattiprolu was used on an urn containing the relics of Buddha [18]. This is considered as the rosetta stone for decipherment of Tamil Brahmi [19]. Kadamba script, derived from Bhattiprolu Brahmi later led to the evolution of Telugu and Kannada scripts [20]. The Satavahana dynasty dominated the Deccan Plateau from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE. It had trade relations with the Roman Empire [22]. The Satavahanas made Dhanyakataka-Amaravathi their capital [23]. According to historian Stanley Wolpert, it might have been the most prosperous city in India in 2nd century CE. Nagarjuna, the philosopher of Mahayana, lived in this region [24] [25]. Mahayana spread to China, Japan, and Korea [26]. It became the largest Buddhist denomination in the world. Amaravati School of Art is regarded as one of the three major styles of ancient Indian art and had a great influence on art in South India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia [29] [30]. The Andhra Ikshvakus, with their capital at Vijayapuri, succeeded the Satavahanas in the Krishna River valley in the latter half of the 2nd century CE . The Salankayanas were an ancient dynasty that ruled the Andhra region between Godavari and Krishna rivers with their capital at Vengi (modern Pedavegi) around 300 CE [32]. Telugu Cholas ruled present-day Kadapa region from the six to the thirteenth centuries intermittently . Kallamalla sasanam (law), engraved in 575 CE during the rule of Dhanamjaya, is the earliest completely Telugu inscription [34]. The Vishnukundinas was the first dynasty in the fifth and sixth centuries to hold sway over South India. Undavalli Caves is an example of Indian rock-cut architecture of that time [36]. The Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, whose dynasty lasted for around five hundred years from the 7th century until 1130 CE, eventually merged with the Chola dynasty [37]. They continued to rule under the protection of the Chola dynasty until 1189 CE. At the request of King Rajaraja Narendra, Nannaya, considered the first Telugu poet, took up the translation of the Mahabharata into Telugu in 1025 CE [38]. Kakatiyas ruled this region and Telangana for nearly two hundred years between the 12th and 14th centuries. They were defeated by the Delhi Sultanate. Bahamani sultanate took over when Delhi sultanate became weak [40]. Around the same time, Musunuris and Reddi Kingdom ruled parts of this region in the early 14th century [41] [42]. Reddy kings constructed Kondaveedu Fort and Kondapalli Fort [43]. Gajpathis ruled parts of this region, before the entire region became part of the Vijayanagara Empire during the reign of Krishnadevaraya [44] [45]. Pemmasani Nayaks controlled parts of Andhra Pradesh and had large mercenary armies that were the vanguard of the empire in the 16th century [46]. Several tanks and anicuts were built [47] [48]. Some of these include the Cumbum tank, Mopad tank, and Koregal anicut, Vallabhapur anicut across the Tungabhadra River. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form [49]. The Lepakshi group of monuments built during this period have mural paintings of the Vijayanagara kings, Dravidian art, and inscriptions [50]. These are put on the tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage committee. 

## Modern history

Following the defeat of the Vijayanagara Empire, the Qutb Shahi dynasty held sway over most of present-day general Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Later, this region came under the rule of the Mughal Empire. Chin Qilich Khan who was initially appointed as viceroy of Deccan by the Mughal in 1713, established himself as a semi-independent ruler as Nizam of Hyderabad [53]. In 1765, British Lord Robert Clive obtained from the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II a grant of four circars to the British East India Company, that was formalised in 1978 treaty with Nizam Ali, the 5th Nizam of Hyderabad state with addition of another circar . Later, four territories were ceded to the British by Nizam Ali in 1800, which eventually became the Rayalaseema region. Meanwhile, in the present day North Andhra, Raja Viziaram Raz (Vijayaram Raj) established a sovereign kingdom and acquired neighbouring estates with the support of British [55]. Later it fell out with the British and, as a result, was attacked and defeated in the battle of Padmanabham in 1794. It was annexed as a tributary estate like other principalities and remained so until it acceded to the Indian Union in 1949. Following the annexation of Carnatic sultanate in 1801, the last major piece of the present day Andhra Pradesh came under British East India Company rule as part of Madras Presidency [56]. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the region became part of British crown till India became independent in 1947 [57]. Anicut at Dowleswaram built in 1850 by Arthur Cotton  and several others at Vijayawada, Nellore, Sangam, Sunkesula, and Polampalli are examples of irrigation facilities built during the British raj, that irrigated lacs of acres across coastal districts [59]. Buckingham Canal built during 1806–1878, running parallel to the Coramandal coast from Kakinada to Marakkanam in Tamil Nadu served as a major water transportation route for goods till the 1960s [49]. Telegraph service initiated in 1850 served for over 160 years till it was stopped on 15 July 2013 citing poor patronage due to advances in mobile communications and short message service [60]. Charles Philip Brown did pioneering work in transforming Telugu to the print era and introduced Vemana poems to English readers [61]. Kandukuri Veeresalingam is considered the father of the Telugu renaissance movement, as he encouraged the education of women and lower caste people [62]. He fought against Brahmin marriage customs such as child marriage, the bride price system, and the prohibition of widow remarriage. To gain an independent state based on linguistic identity and to protect the interests of the Telugu-speaking people of Madras State, Potti Sreeramulu fasted to death in 1952. The Telugu-speaking area of Andhra State was carved out of Madras state on 1 October 1953, with Kurnool as its capital city. On the basis of the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1956, the States reorganisation act created Andhra Pradesh by merging the neighbouring Telugu-speaking areas of the Hyderabad State with Hyderabad as the capital on 1 November 1956 [64]. Hyderabad grew rapidly partly through investments flowing in from agrarian change and 'green revolution' in coastal Andhra [65]. In the unified state, Indian National Congress (INC) enjoyed a monopoly in ruling the state till 1983. After that Telugu Desam Party (TDP) led by N. T. Rama Rao (NTR) came to power and became another major party to rule the state. Nagarjuna Sagar Dam commissioned in 1967, Srisailam hydro electric project commissioned in 1982 are few examples of irrigation and electricity projects [67]. The increased presence of women, Dalits, and tribals in the social and political spheres of the state, driven by social movements, led to a rise in violence against these groups [68] [69]. Securing access to resources like land remains an unachieved objective in the effort to expand their economic opportunities in the state. When the union cabinet decided to consider the formation of Telangana state in 2009 heeding to the demand of relaunched Telangana movement, Samaikyandhra Movement opposing it took shape and the state went through a turmoil [70]. Finally, the Andhra Pradesh reorganisation act bill was passed by the parliament of India for the formation of the Telangana state, despite opposition by the state legislature [71]. The new state of Telangana came into existence on 2 June 2014 after approval from the president of India, with the residual state continuing as Andhra Pradesh [72]. TDP formed the first government of the residual state with Chandrababu Naidu as chief minister. In 2017, the government of Andhra Pradesh began operating from its new greenfield capital, Amaravati, for which 33,000 acres were acquired from farmers through an innovative land pooling scheme [74]. In the 2019 elections, Y [75]. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, leader of the YSR Congress Party, became the chief minister by winning 151 out of 175 seats. He introduced the 'village and ward volunteers' system,  and reorganised the state with 26 districts [76] [77]. Introduction of English as the medium of instruction was done in almost all the state schools [78]. The move to three capitals with Amaravati getting reduced to being the legislative capital, Vizag as the executive capital and Kurnool as the judicial capital was stuck down by the High Court. His government appealed to the Supreme Court.

The state has five different soil types with the majority soil types being red lateritic and black soil types. Most of the coastal plains are put to intensive agricultural use [87]. The Kadapa basin, formed by two arching branches of the Eastern ghats, is a mineral-rich area [88]. The valleys include Araku Valley, which is rich in biodiversity  and Gandikota gorge [90]. Gandikota gorge is a canyon formed between the Erramala range of hills, through which the Penna (Pennar) river flows. Borra Caves, created millions of years ago by water activity  and the country's second-longest cave system, the Belum Caves are in the state [91] [92].

The vegetation found in the state is largely of dry deciduous types, with a mixture of teak, and genera of Terminalia, Dalbergia, Pterocarpus, etc. The state possesses some rare and endemic plants like Cycas beddomei, Pterocarpus santalinus, Terminalia pallida, Syzygium alternifolium, Shorea tumburgia etc. The state has 3 national parks and 13 wildlife sanctuaries as of 2019 [update]. The diversity of fauna includes tigers, leopards, cheetals, sambars, sea turtles, and several birds and reptiles [96]. The estuaries of the Godavari and Krishna rivers support rich mangrove forests with fishing cats and otters as keystone species. Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary is an example of mangrove forests and salt-tolerant forest ecosystems near the sea [97]. The area of these forests is 582 km2 (225 sq mi), accounting for about 9% of the local forest area of the state. Other sanctuaries include Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve,  Kolleru Bird Sanctuary,  and Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary [98] [99] [100].

## Literature

Nannayya, Tikkana, and Yerrapragada form the trinity who translated the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata into Telugu during 11–14 centuries. Nannayya wrote the first treatise on Telugu grammar, called Andhra Shabda Chintamani in Sanskrit . Pothana translated Bhagavatam into Telugu [143]. Vemana was an Indian philosopher who wrote Telugu poems using simple language and native idioms on a variety of subjects including yoga, wisdom, and morality . Potuluri Veerabrahmendhra swami, a clairvoyant and social reformer of 17th century, wrote Kalagnanam, a book of predictions . Telugu literature after Kandukuri Veeresalingam is termed Adhunika Telugu Sahityam (modern Telugu literature). He was the author of the first Telugu social novel Rajasekhara Charitram, published in 1880 [149]. The use of colloquial idiom rather than grandhik (classical) in literature, championed by Gurajada Apparao and Gidugu Ramamurthy Panthulu led to increased literacy [150]. Various forms of literature such as poetry, novel, short story were vibrant as indicated by the responses to national and international developments in various spheres of human life . The modern Telugu poetry, which began around 1900 developed into three forms – Bhava kavitvam (lyrical poetry), Abhyudaya kavitvam (progressive poetry), and new experimental poetry, including Viplava kavitvam (revolutionary poetry) . Gurajada Apparao, Rayaprolu Subbarao, Gurram Jashuva, Viswanatha Satyanarayana, Devulapalli Krishnasastri, and Sri Sri were some of the modern Telugu poets. Palagummi Padmaraju's short story Galivaana won second prize in World Short Story competition in 1952. Rachakonda Viswanadha Sastry initiated a new trend by focussing on the downtrodden in his novel Raju-Mahishi [153]. Women writers such as Malati Chandur and Ranganayakamma dominated novels in the 1950s and 1960s. However, in the late 1970s, Yandamuri Veerendranath started writing popular novels with a focus on sex, suspense and violence, which were serialised in magazines. Viswanatha Satyanarayana was conferred the first Jnanpith Award for Telugu literature in 1970 . Telugu film song as literature took shape in the 1930s [154]. Some of the famous lyric writers include Samudrala Senior, Arudra, Athreya, Daasarathi, and C. Narayana Reddy. 

## Architecture

Traditional temple architecture is influenced by Dravidian and Vijayanagara styles. In Dravidian architecture for which Tirumala temple is an example, the temples consisted of porches or mantapas preceding the door leading to the sanctum, gate-pyramids or gopurams in quadrangular enclosures that surround the temple, and pillared halls used for many purposes. Besides these, the temple usually has a tank called the Kalyani or pushkarni. The gopuram is a monumental tower, usually ornate at the entrance of the temple forms a prominent feature [156]. They are topped by the kalasam, a bulbous stone finial [157]. Vimanam are similar structures built over the garbhagriha or inner sanctum of the temple but are usually smaller than the gopurams . In the Vijayanagar style for which Lepakshi Veerabhadra temple is an example, the main temple is laid out in three parts, these are: The assembly hall known as the mukha mantapa; arda mantapa or antarala (ante chamber); and the garbhagriha or the sanctum sanctorum [159] [160]. Sri Venkateswara institute of traditional sculpture and architecture, run by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams offers diploma courses [161]. Civic architecture which mainly featured courtyard structure to support joint family system and simple round houses is giving way to modern apartments [162]. 

## Arts

Kondapalli Toys, the soft limestone idol carvings of Durgi  and Etikoppaka lacquered wooden toys are few handicrafts with GI status [165]. Kuchipudi, the cultural dance recognised as the official dance form of the state of Andhra Pradesh, originated in the village of Kuchipudi in Krishna district [166]. Several renowned composers of Carnatic music like Annamacharya, Kshetrayya, Tyagaraja, and Bhadrachala Ramadas hailed from the state [167]. Sannai and Dolu are common musical instruments of marriages, household, and temple functions in the state [168]. Harikathaa Kalakshepam (or Harikatha) involves the narration of a story, intermingled with various songs relating to the story [170]. Burra katha is an oral storytelling technique in which the topic is either a Hindu mythological story or a contemporary social issue . Drama is an Indian theatre art form that is still popular [172]. Gurajada Apparao wrote the play Kanyasulkam in spoken dialect for the first time [173]. It was first presented in 1892. It is considered the greatest play in the Telugu language [174]. The Telugu film industry (known as "Tollywood") is primarily based in Hyderabad, though several films are shot in Vizag. About 300 films are produced annually,  C [176]. Pullaiah is cited as the father of the Telugu cinema. Film producer D [177] [178]. Ramanaidu holds a Guinness record for the most films produced by a person. Music composers and playback singers of the state include Ghantasala, S [179]. P. Balasubrahmanyam, P. Susheela, S. Janaki, and P. B. Sreenivas. "Naatu Naatu" from the film RRR became the first song from an Asian film to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2023 [180]. Efforts are on to make Vizag as the hub of film industry by offering incentives [181] [182]. 

## Festivals

Sankranti is the major harvest festival celebrated across the state. It is celebrated for four days in the second week of January [184]. The first day of the Telugu new year Ugadi which occurs during March/April is also a special festival with the preparation and sharing of pickles (pachhadi) made from raw mangoes, neem flowers, pepper powder, jaggery and tamarind. Tasting this pickle which is a mix of different tastes teaches the importance of taking positive/negative life experiences in one's stride. Celebrations end with the recitation of the coming year's astrological predictions called Panchanga sravanam. Vijaya Dasami known commonly as Dussera and Deepavali, the festival of lights are other major Hindu festivals. Shivaratri is celebrated at Kotappakonda, with people from nearby villages preparing 80–100 ft height frames called prabhalu and taking it in a procession to the shine [185]. Eid is celebrated with special prayers. Rottela Panduga is celebrated at Bara Shaheed Dargah in Nellore with participation across religious lines [186].
