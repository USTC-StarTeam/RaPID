# Early life and education

James Earl Jones was born in Arkabutla, Mississippi, on January 17, 1931,   to Ruth (née Connolly); (1911–1986), a teacher and maid, and Robert Earl Jones (1910–2006), a boxer, butler, and chauffeur [12] [13]. His father left the family shortly after James Earl's birth and later became a stage and screen actor in New York and Hollywood. Jones and his father did not get to know each other until the 1950s, when they reconciled [14]. He said in interviews that his parents were both of mixed African-American, Irish, and Native American ancestry. From the age of five, Jones was raised by his maternal grandparents, John Henry and Maggie Connolly,  on their farm in Dublin, Michigan; they had moved from Mississippi in the Great Migration [12]. Jones found the transition to living with his grandparents in Michigan traumatic and developed a stutter so severe that he refused to speak [17]. He said, "I was a stutterer. I couldn't talk. So my first year of school was my first mute year, and then those mute years continued until I got to high school."  He credited his English teacher, Donald Crouch, who discovered he had a gift for writing poetry, with helping him end his silence [17]. Crouch urged him to challenge his reluctance to speak through reading poetry aloud to the class [14]. In 1949, Jones graduated from Dickson Rural Agricultural School  (now Brethren High School) in Brethren, Michigan, where he served as vice president of his class [20]. He attended the University of Michigan, where he was initially a pre-med major. He joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps and excelled [14]. He felt comfortable within the structure of the military environment and enjoyed the camaraderie of his fellow cadets in the Pershing Rifles Drill Team and Scabbard and Blade Honor Society. After his junior year,  he focused on drama with the thought of doing something he enjoyed, before, he assumed, he would have to go off to fight in the Korean War [23]. Jones graduated from the university in 1955 with a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in drama. 

# Military service

With the Korean War intensifying, Jones expected to be deployed as soon as he received his commission as a second lieutenant. While he waited for his orders, he worked on the stage crew and acted at the Ramsdell Theatre in Manistee, Michigan. Jones was commissioned in mid-1953, after the Korean War's end, and reported to Fort Benning (now Fort Moore) to attend the Infantry Officers Basic Course [26]. He attended Ranger School and received his Ranger Tab. Jones was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 38th Regimental Combat Team. He was initially to report to Fort Leonard Wood, but his unit was instead sent to establish a cold-weather training command at the former Camp Hale near Leadville, Colorado [27]. His battalion became a training unit in the rugged terrain of the Rocky Mountains [28]. Jones was promoted to first lieutenant prior to his discharge. Jones moved to New York City, where he studied at the American Theatre Wing and worked as a janitor to support himself. 

# Career

## 1953–1972: Early roles and Shakespeare in the Park

Jones began his acting career at the Ramsdell Theatre in Manistee, Michigan. In 1953, he was a stage carpenter, and between 1955 and 1957, he acted and was a stage manager. In his first acting season at the Ramsdell, he portrayed Othello. His early career also included an appearance in the ABC radio anthology series Theatre-Five [33]. In 1957, he made his Broadway debut as understudy to Lloyd Richards in the short-lived play, The Egghead, by Molly Kazan [34]. The play ran only 21 performances,  but three months later, in January 1958, Jones created the featured role of Edward the butler in Dore Schary's Sunrise at Campobello at the Cort Theatre [35] [36]. During the early to mid 1960s, Jones acted in various works of William Shakespeare, becoming one of the best known Shakespearean actors of the time. He tackled roles such as Othello and King Lear, Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Abhorson in Measure for Measure, and Claudius in Hamlet all at Shakespeare in the Park. In 1961, Jones appeared in an Off-Broadway production of The Blacks by Jean Genet, alongside eight subsequently prominent Black actors, including Roscoe Lee Browne, Cicely Tyson, Lou Gossett and others. The New York Public Library has a collection of photographs of this production, including one of Tyson and Jones [38]. During a production of The Merchant of Venice at Shakespeare in the Park, Stanley Kubrick saw George C [39]. Scott play Shylock and Jones portray the Prince of Morocco. Kubrick was there initially to cast Scott in Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), but then considered Jones saying "I'll take the black one too". Jones portrayed young Lt. Lothar Zogg, the B-52 bombardier in the film, this would be his feature film debut. Jones would later play a surgeon and Haitian rebel leader in The Comedians, alongside Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, and Alec Guinness. In December 1967, Jones starred alongside Jane Alexander in Howard Sackler's play, The Great White Hope, at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C [23]. Jones took the role of the talented but troubled boxer "Jack Jefferson", who is based on the real champion Jack Johnson. The play was a huge success when it moved to Broadway on October 3, 1968. The play was well received, winning the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Jones himself won the 1969 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play, and the Drama Desk Award for his performance. In 1969, Jones participated in making test films for the children's education series Sesame Street; these shorts, combined with animated segments, were shown to groups of children to gauge the effectiveness of the then-groundbreaking Sesame Street format. As cited by production notes included in the DVD release Sesame Street: Old School 1969–1974, the short that had the greatest impact with test audiences was one showing bald-headed Jones counting slowly to ten. This and other segments featuring Jones were eventually aired as part of the Sesame Street series itself when it debuted later in 1969 and Jones is often cited as the first celebrity guest on that series, although a segment with Carol Burnett was the first to actually be broadcast. He also appeared on the soap opera Guiding Light [14]. In 1970, Jones reunited with Jane Alexander in the film adaptation of The Great White Hope. This would be Jones's first leading film role. Jones portrayed boxer Jack Johnson, a role he had previously originated on stage. His performance was acclaimed by critics and earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He was the second African-American male performer after Sidney Poitier to be nominated for this award. Variety described his performance declaring, "Jones' recreation of his stage role is an eye-riveting experience [14]. The towering rages and unrestrained joys of which his character was capable are portrayed larger than life."  In The Man (1972), Jones starred as a senator who unexpectedly becomes the first African-American president of the United States [44]. 

## 1973–1983: Star Wars and rise to prominence

In 1973, Jones played Hickey on Broadway at the Circle in the Square Theater in a revival of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh  and starred in the title role of William Shakespeare's King Lear opposite Paul Sorvino, René Auberjonois, and Raul Julia at the New York City Shakespeare Festival in Central Park, which was recorded and broadcast in the PBS Great Performances series the following year [45]. In 1974, Jones played Lennie on Broadway in the 1974 Brooks Atkinson Theatre production of the adaptation of John Steinbeck's novella, Of Mice and Men, with Kevin Conway as George and Pamela Blair as Curley's wife [46]. In 1974, Jones co-starred with Diahann Carroll in the film Claudine,  the story of a woman who raises her six children alone after two failed and two "almost" marriages [13]. The film is a romantic comedy and drama, focusing on systemic racial disparities black families face. It was one of the first major films to tackle themes such as welfare, economic inequality, and the typical marriage of men and women in the African American community during the 1970s. Jones and Carroll received widespread critical acclaim and Golden Globe nominations for their performances. Carroll was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress [48]. In 1977, Jones played Balthazar in the television series  Jesus of Nazareth. That same year, he made his debut in his iconic voiceover role as Darth Vader in George Lucas's space opera blockbuster film Star Wars: A New Hope, which he would reprise for the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). Darth Vader was portrayed in costume by David Prowse in the film trilogy, with Jones dubbing Vader's dialogue in post-production because Prowse's strong West Country accent was deemed unsuitable for the role by director George Lucas. At his own request, Jones was uncredited for the release of the first two Star Wars films,  though he would be credited for the third film and eventually also for the first film's 1997 "Special Edition" re-release [50] [51]. As he explained in a 2008 interview: [52]. In 1977, Jones also received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Great American Documents. In late 1979, Jones appeared on the short-lived CBS police drama Paris [53]. Jones also starred that year in the critically acclaimed TV mini-series sequel Roots: The Next Generations as the older version of author Alex Haley [54]. 

## 1985–1999: Established career

In 1987, Jones starred in August Wilson's play Fences as Troy Maxson, a middle aged working class father who struggles to provide for his family. The play, set in the 1950s, is part of Wilson's ten-part "Pittsburgh Cycle" [23]. The play explores the evolving African American experience and examines race relations, among other themes. Jones won widespread critical acclaim, earning himself his second Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. Beside the Star Wars sequels, Jones was featured in several other box office hits of the 1980s: the action/fantasy film Conan the Barbarian (1982),  the Eddie Murphy comedy Coming to America (1988),  and the sports drama/fantasy Field of Dreams (1989)  which earned an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination [13] [23] [23] [23].

Gabriel's Fire  and a revamped version called Pros and Cons aired on ABC between 1990 and 1992 [23]. In both formats of that show, Jones played a former policeman wrongly convicted of murder who, upon his release from prison, becomes a private eye. In 1995, Jones starred in Under One Roof as Neb Langston, a widowed African-American police officer sharing his home in Seattle with his daughter, his married son and children, and Neb's newly adopted son. The show was a mid-season replacement and lasted only six weeks, but earned him another Emmy nomination [60]. He also portrayed Thad Green on "Mathnet", a parody of Dragnet that appeared in the PBS program Square One Television.

President George W. Bush joked, "People say that the voice of the president is the most easily recognized voice in America.

In a statement, CNN said that Jones "was the voice of CNN and our brand for many decades, uniquely conveying through speech instant authority, grace, and decorum [109] [94] [127]. That remarkable voice is just one of many things the world will miss about James."  Jones's alma mater, the University of Michigan, paid tribute to him by posting a "We Are Michigan" video narrated by Jones on X [111]. The NAACP, SAG-AFTRA, The Public Theater, and MLB also paid tribute to Jones [112] [113]. The Empire State Building in New York City was lit up to resemble Darth Vader [114].

Vance, and Alec Baldwin. Following his death, The New York Times described Jones's career as a "a prodigious body of work" and called him "one of America's most versatile actors in a stage, film and television career". The Hollywood Reporter referred to Jones as "one of the most-admired American actors of all time" [12]. The Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote, "like Sidney Poitier or Harry Belafonte or Paul Robeson,  [Jones] was an African American actor with a beautiful voice which was the key to his dignity and self-respect as a performer; it was how his characters rose above racism and cruelty", and described Jones as "movie royalty" [13]. Academy Award–winning actress Viola Davis said that Jones's career reflected "black excellence" [124]. Jones was recognized as a groundbreaker and pioneer for African Americans for his significant roles on stage and television. In 1965, Jones became one of the first African American actors in a continuing role on a daytime drama acting in As the World Turns [12]. Critic Clive Barnes said that Jones's theater roles were "like a black avenging angel .. [126]. Even when corrupted by misery, his presence has an almost moral force to it, and his voice rasps out an agony nearly too personally painful in its nakedness". In 2011, Academy Award-nominated actor Alec Baldwin called Jones "one of the greatest actors in American history" [127]. In 2022, the Cort Theatre was renamed after James Earl Jones, becoming the second Broadway venue named after a Black theatrical artist, the first being the August Wilson Theatre named after the playwright August Wilson [5].
