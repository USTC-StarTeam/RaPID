Hurricane_Rafael

Hurricane Rafael was the strongest November tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico on record, tied with 1985's Hurricane Kate. The seventeenth named storm, eleventh hurricane, and fifth major hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, Rafael formed on November 4, 2024 from an area of low-pressure spawned by a Central American gyre. Steady organization occurred throughout the next two days, with Rafael becoming a hurricane early on November 6, as it moved northwest towards Cuba. Favorable conditions enabled the cyclone to rapidly intensify, becoming a Category 3 major hurricane later that day before landfall in Cuba. Then, after weakening some while over land, it entered the Gulf of Mexico and re-intensified to a major hurricane once again at peak intensity early on November 8. Hostile conditions, including wind shear and cooler sea-surface temperatures, caused the hurricane to rapidly weaken afterward, falling below hurricane intensity later that day, and eventually degenerating into a remnant low on November 10. The circulation opened up into a trough the next day.
Two deaths have been confirmed in Jamaica as a result of flooding caused by Rafael. Additionally, at least five deaths in Panama occurred due to heavy flooding and landslides produced by Rafael's precursor disturbance, along with one death in Colombia. Preliminary damages are estimated to be at least US$1.2 billion.

# Meteorological history

On October 26, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the southwestern Caribbean in anticipation of tropical development. Several days later, on November 1, a broad area of low pressure developed over the southwestern Caribbean,  associated with a Central American gyre [4]. The disturbance initially remained disorganized, but began showing signs of organization on November 3 [5]. That afternoon, Air Force Hurricane Hunters collected data showing that the system had developed a closed center but that deep convection had not yet become organized enough for it to be declared a tropical depression. Due to the disturbance's impending threat to Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, the NHC designated the developing storm Potential Tropical Cyclone Eighteen. The following day, data from the Hurricane Hunters, satellite imagery, and surface observations revealed that the disturbance had developed a well-defined center and was producing organized deep convection; it was accordingly upgraded to Tropical Depression Eighteen the morning of November 4 [6]. At the time, the newly-formed cyclone was located about 195 mi (310 km) south of Kingston, Jamaica. Amid favorable conditions, including warmer than average sea surface temperatures of 30 °C (86 °F),  the depression continued to strengthen and became Tropical Storm Rafael that afternoon [8] [9]. The storm tracked northwestward along the southwestern side of a ridge over the western Atlantic on November 5,  and passed to the west of Jamaica [10] [11] [12]. That afternoon it developed an inner wind core,  and strengthened into a hurricane early on November 6 [13] [12]. Rapid intensification ensued throughout the morning as a small eye became visible, with Rafael becoming a Category 3 major hurricane that afternoon as it neared Cuba,  eventually making landfall in the province of Artemisa, just east of Playa Majana, at 21:15 UTC on November 6, with sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) [14] [15]. A few hours later, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico as a weaker Category 2 hurricane [16]. It then proceeded to turn west-northwestward and re-intensify, becoming a major hurricane once again early on November 8 with peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) [17]. Later that afternoon, however, the system turned westward and began losing strength and organization due to increasing westerly wind shear and dry air intrusion. This trend continued, and Rafael was downgraded to a tropical storm late that same day [19]. By late the following day, the storm's convection was limited to the northeast of an exposed and broad low-level center [20]. On November 10, Rafael's remaining convection collapsed, and it degenerated into a remnant low while drifting over the central Gulf,  before opening up into a trough on the next day [21] [22]. The remnant trough continued meandering until dissipating early on November 13.. 

# Preparations

## Panama

On November 2, the Government of Panama issued a red warning from Chiriquí to Veraguas. Panama's emergency services agency asked residents and tourists to pay attention to weather warnings issued by authorities and noted the threat of heavy rain and strong waves. Several yellow alerts, signifying the threat of the impending weather, were issued for the western portion of the nation. Colón, Coclé, and Kuna Yala had red warnings declared for them [23]. Classes were suspended in five provinces, while the government opened nine emergency shelters [24]. 

## Jamaica

Officials in Jamaica blamed persistent rains ahead of the potential storm for a large landslide on November 3, which left several rural communities isolated. Heavy rains from Rafael caused several road blockages, with garbage propelled by the storm blocking a road in Saint Andrew Parish and a landslide blocking another road in Saint Catherine Parish [10]. At the latter parish, two people were found dead in a vehicle that was swept away by the floods [60]. Several of Jamaica's southern parishes received over 3 in (76 mm) of rainfall [61]. Rainfall from Rafael exacerbated flooding in Troja district, causing several fords to break away throughout the area [62]. The storm caused flooding and landslides and knocked the nation's power grid offline [63]. According to the Jamaican government, damage in infrastructure and agriculture totaled at J$1.27 billion (US$8 million) [64] [65]. 

## Cayman Islands

Torrential rainfall from Rafael caused the islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac to lose power. Grand Cayman saw rough seas and flooding from Rafael [32]. Power lines and trees were downed on Little Cayman, with roads covered with sand and debris. Additionally, multiple dive boats sank off the coast of Little Cayman [32] [68]. Cayman Brac saw numerous trees uprooted and significant shingle damage,  with multiple docks and power lines also being damaged [69] [70]. 

## Cuba

Rafael's strong winds caused an island-wide power-grid failure. In western Cuba, 300 mm (12 in) of rain was reported, resulting in flooding and landslides [90] [81]. Government officials reported that areas in and around Artemisa sustained the worst damage from Rafael [82]. In Artemisa, 2,825 homes were damaged, in addition to hospitals, schools, and service centers [83] [84]. Nearly 40,000 acres of crops were either damaged or lost. In neighboring Mayabeque, 441 homes were damaged, and agriculture was badly affected. Rafael passed about 30 mi (48 km) west of Havana, with sustained winds of 44 mph (71 km/h) being recorded, along with gusts of up to 71 mph (114 km/h) [83] [85] [86]. Rainfall from the hurricane flooded several neighborhoods in Centro Habana and Old Havana [2]. Numerous homes and public buildings were damaged, trees were uprooted, and telephone poles toppled [87]. Damages caused by Rafael were calculated at 25.8 billion pesos (US$1.08 billion) [83] [88]. 

## United States

While Rafael did not approach the U.S. Gulf Coast, it did churn up rip currents along much of the coast on November 9 and 10. In addition, Rafael impacted the Florida Keys with up to 2 in (51 mm) of rain and gusts up to 53 mph (85 km/h) [90] [91]. However, no significant damages were reported [92]. Despite being 500 miles from the center of the storm, moisture from Rafael caused significant flooding in Georgia and South Carolina, with 12 inches of rain falling in less than 24 hours. 

### Florida

A tropical storm watch was issued on November 4 for the lower and middle Florida Keys from Key West to the west of the Channel 5 Bridge and for the Dry Tortugas. On November 5, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for the lower and middle Florida Keys [10]. As a precaution, schools in Monroe County were closed on November 6 [43]. 

# Impact

## Panama and Costa Rica

In Panama, rains from the incipient disturbance of Rafael damaged several homes, leaving a total of more than 1,097 displaced. About 100 people were housed in shelters [45] [46]. At least five people died in the nation as a result, with another two remaining missing [25]. More than 200 families were affected by the rains in Herrera and Los Santos Provinces [47] [48]. Damages in Panama were at least $110 million [49]. Additionally, interaction between the disturbance and the Pacific Intertropical Convergence Zone caused flooding in Costa Rica. This resulted in a bridge collapse and 42 people needing to be rescued in Guanacaste Province [51]. Agricultural losses in Costa Rica were at least ₡500 million (US$980,000) [52]. 

## Colombia

In Colombia, Rafael's precursor caused torrential rainfall in the Santa Marta area. Rockslides occurred and several cars were swept away by floodwaters. Some homes also sustained damage, with two of them destroyed. One person also suffered from minor injuries. Multiple structures were declared at risk of collapse. In La Guajira Department, one person drowned,  192,465 people and 38,493 families were affected,  with multiple streams overflowing resulting in numerous roads and houses being flooded [54] [55] [56]. 700 billion pesos (US$159 million) were requested to assist those who were affected by the storm [57]. As of January 2025, damages in Colombia are estimated to be at USD$150 million, according to AON [58]. 

## Jamaica

Officials in Jamaica blamed persistent rains ahead of the potential storm for a large landslide on November 3, which left several rural communities isolated. Heavy rains from Rafael caused several road blockages, with garbage propelled by the storm blocking a road in Saint Andrew Parish and a landslide blocking another road in Saint Catherine Parish [10].
