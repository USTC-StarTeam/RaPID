Longlegs

Longlegs is a 2024 American police procedural horror film written and directed by Osgood Perkins and starring Maika Monroe, Alicia Witt, Blair Underwood, and Nicolas Cage. It follows an FBI agent in the 1990s who is tasked with tracking down an occultist serial killer responsible for murdering multiple families throughout Oregon. Cage served as a producer on the film through his Saturn Films production company.
Longlegs was released in the United States by Neon on July 12, 2024. It received critical acclaim and grossed $127 million worldwide on a budget of less than $10 million, becoming Neon's highest-grossing film domestically, the highest-grossing independent film of the year, and Perkins' highest-grossing film.

# Plot

In 1974 Oregon, a young girl with a Polaroid camera follows a mysterious voice and encounters an erratic man in pale makeup.. Twenty years later, FBI agent Lee Harker, who exhibits possible clairvoyance, is assigned by her supervisor William Carter to a case involving a series of murder–suicides in Oregon. Each case involves a father killing his family and himself, leaving behind a letter with Satanic coding signed "Longlegs", whose handwriting belongs to none of the family members. Lee discovers that each family had a nine-year-old daughter born on the 14th of the month, the murders all occurred within six days before or after said birthday, and the murders form an occult triangle symbol on a calendar, with one date missing. While talking to her mother Ruth, Lee receives a coded birthday card from Longlegs, warning her that revealing the source of the code will lead to her mother's murder.. Following a clue, Lee and William find a doll with a high-energy metal orb inside. After visiting a mental hospital to question Carrie Anne Camera, the sole survivor of Longlegs's attacks who was visited previously by someone using Lee's name, William suspects Lee has a connection to Longlegs. Discovering that Ruth had filed a police report of an intruder approaching Lee the day before her ninth birthday, William encourages Lee to talk to her. Ruth directs Lee to her childhood belongings, where she finds a Polaroid of the pale-faced man, revealing Longlegs to be the man who had visited a young Lee on her birthday. Lee submits the photo, leading to Longlegs's arrest. Realizing the missing date is that day, Lee fears an accomplice will commit the final murder. In the interrogation room, Longlegs claims to serve "the man downstairs" and hints at Ruth's involvement before killing himself. Lee is soon informed that Carrie has committed suicide.. Agent Browning drives Lee to Ruth's home, where Lee witnesses Ruth kill Browning with a shotgun. Ruth then destroys a doll resembling a young Lee, causing Lee to lose consciousness. Lee sees that Ruth has been Longlegs's accomplice since her childhood. Longlegs forced Ruth to choose between her daughter's death and his bidding, leading her to comply and spare Lee. Longlegs has since lived in the Harker basement, creating Satanic dolls that Ruth, posing as a nun, delivered to households, causing the patriarchs to commit familicide. Lee's doll blocked her memories of Longlegs whilst influencing her with his magic.. Lee awakens in the basement and answers the phone, where a demonic voice warns her about William's daughter Ruby's ninth birthday party scheduled for that day. Lee rushes to save the Carters, whose deaths would complete Longlegs's triangle. She finds the family already possessed, with Ruth having delivered the doll. After William kills his wife Anna, Lee shoots him to protect Ruby. Ruth attacks Lee with a dagger, forcing Lee to shoot her. Lee tries to destroy the doll, but her gun does not fire. Staring at the doll, she tells Ruby they need to leave.. 

# Production

The film was announced in November 2022, with Osgood Perkins as writer and director. He drew inspiration from several sources; the plot device of the evil dolls that cause fathers to murder their families was loosely inspired by the killing of JonBenét Ramsey: "The murder took place approaching Christmas, and one present that the parents had gotten for JonBenét was a life-size replica doll of herself, wearing one of her pageant dresses [7]. It was in a cardboard box in the basement, 15 feet from where she was killed, and there was something so insane about that, I'd cataloged it away." [8]. Perkins told People magazine that the film was inspired by his mother's treatment towards father Anthony Perkins's sexuality, shielding the public and the Perkins children from knowledge of his homosexual relationships. Oz Perkins was quoted, saying, "Your mother can protect you from a truth that she thinks is unsavory...And then you just build out a crazy movie around that.” [9]. In February 2023, Nicolas Cage and Maika Monroe came on board to star, with Cage also producing under his Saturn Films banner. In March, Alicia Witt and Blair Underwood were announced as part of the cast [10] [11]. Dave Caplan's C2 Motion Picture Group financed the film for under $10 million. Principal photography was scheduled to take place in Vancouver from January 16 to February 23, 2023 [54]. 

# Music

The film's soundtrack was conceived by Zilgi, a pseudonym for Elvis Perkins (the brother of the film's director),  credited as composer of the score compositions on the digital soundtrack album [14]. There were contributing tracks by sound designer Eugenio Battagila and Melody Carrillo with Elizabeth Wight [15]. The soundtrack was released on July 12, 2024, on streaming platforms and on vinyl. 

# Marketing

Neon used guerilla marketing tactics similar to those that led to the box office success of The Blair Witch Project (1999), building speculation through clips, images, and coded messages that used symbology created for the film and concealed Cage's look as Longlegs. Eleven promotional videos were uploaded to YouTube leading up to release, the first appearing in January 2024, which did not mention the film's title until February; together, the videos accumulated 30 million views [17]. A trailer was attached to every horror film released in theaters since January 2024 [54] [19] [19]. Additional content included a billboard (with no mention of the title) that featured a phone number for pre-recorded messages from the film's antagonist,  and a paid advertisement featuring a cipher that was published in the Seattle Times on June 14, a reference to the Zodiac Killer, that directed readers to an in-universe website detailing murders committed in the film [20]. The week of the film's release, Neon released a clip allegedly of Monroe's heartrate when she first saw Cage's character [21]. Following the film's theatrical premiere, Neon released another promotional spot highlighting hidden appearances of the devil that recur in the backgrounds of the film [22]. According to Perkins, there are 15 appearances of the devil in the film which are not readily noticeable [23]. Perkins credited Neon for the film's marketing, saying the studio "asked me early on, 'Do we have your permission to kind of go nuts?' And I said, 'What else are we doing here? Go for it. Do your thing.'"  The film's total marketing budget was under $10 million, focusing on using digital content over traditional television ads [25]. 

# Release

In February 2023, Neon acquired the film's North American rights at the European Film Market. The film had a screening at Los Angeles's Beyond Fest on May 31, 2024 [26]. Longlegs premiered at The Egyptian Theatre Hollywood in Los Angeles on July 8, 2024 [27]. Longlegs held several special screenings across the United States throughout July 8–13, 2024. This also included a 'parent-free' RSVP screening at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Brooklyn, New York on July 12, 2024 [29]. It was released in North America and the United Kingdom on July 12, 2024 [54]. Longlegs was released on VOD on August 23, 2024 [11] [30]. The 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD was released on September 24, 2024. 

# Reception

## Box office

As of October 31, 2024 [update], Longlegs has grossed $74 million in the United States and Canada, and $52 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $126 million. In the United States and Canada, Longlegs was released alongside Fly Me to the Moon, and was projected to gross $7–9 million from 2,510 theaters in its opening weekend. After making $10 million on its first day (including $3 million from Thursday night previews, both records for Neon), weekend estimates were raised to $20–23 million [32]. It went on to debut to $22.4 million, finishing second at the box-office behind holdover Despicable Me 4 [33]. The opening marked the best opening weekend for Neon and the biggest total for an original 2024 horror film [34]. It was Monroe's best domestic opening as lead (excluding 2016's Independence Day: Resurgence, for which she was billed) and Cage's first live-action film to open above $20 million since Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance in 2012. In its second weekend, the film made $12 million, a drop of 46.6% to finish in fourth [54]. In its third weekend, it became Neon's highest-grossing film after surpassing their earnings for 2019's Parasite ($53.37 million) and added $6.8 million [35] [36]. On August 16, 2024, the film had surpassed $100 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing independent film of the year to date [37] [38]. 

## Critical response

The film premiered to critical acclaim. [a] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of 308 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Saturated in disquieting mood while leveraging a nightmarishly gonzo performance by Nicolas Cage, Longlegs is a satanic horror that effectively instills panic."  Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 77 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews . David Rooney writing for The Hollywood Reporter praised the film, saying, "It might be argued that he stirs too many elements into the mix here—crime procedural, occult mystery, mind manipulation, Satanic worship, scary dolls, a Faustian bargain and a 'nun' not fit for any convent. But Longlegs is  [Perkins'] most fully realized and relentlessly effective film to date". Bob Strauss of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, "Most impressive is how Perkins blends psychological and supernatural horror in a manner not quite seen before [47]. Longlegs is a conjuring of dark, poetic cinema where the devil is definitely in the details". Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson expressed disappointment in the film, writing "Longlegs is stylish but vacuous, a prettily foreboding picture with nothing behind it [48]. As Hannibal Lecter might say, it's a well scrubbed, hustling rube with a little taste". J. Hurtado of ScreenAnarchy declared Longlegs "a masterpiece; an unholy, horrifying confluence of high art and anxiety, a film in which every frame is a nightmare, and it's beautiful". Writing for Bloody Disgusting, Meagan Navarro praised Longlegs' performances and atmosphere, concluding, "Longlegs is as stylish as it is timeless, dripping with claustrophobic dread and rot."  Bill Bria of /Film called Longlegs "the most terrifying horror movie of 2024," noting the film's "rock n' roll spirit" [50] [51]. 

## Audience reception

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale. Those polled by PostTrak gave it a 70% overall positive score, with an average 3 out of 5 stars. A correspondent of LGBT magazine Them made note of how some audience members perceived the film's villain to be homophobic or transphobic due to the character's androgynous characteristics. A CNN opinion piece accused the film of transphobia, comparing Longlegs to Buffalo Bill, and emphasizing the horror genre's complicated history of LGBT themes [54]. In a Reddit AMA interview with director Oz Perkins, a fan inquired if the writing of Longlegs was intended to be a negative portrayal of a transgender person. Perkins responded by denouncing anti-trans behavior, but did not specifically elaborate about any element of the film. Director Guillermo Del Toro complimented the film, praising " [Perkins'] metronome, his meticulous composition and his uncanny sense of evil and impending doom." Paul Schrader commented on the film on social media, questioning why directors like Perkins and Ti West were "confined to the horror genre ghetto." [57].
