Eternal_Sunshine_(album)

Eternal Sunshine is the seventh studio album by American singer Ariana Grande. It was released on March 8, 2024, by Republic Records.

Written and produced by Grande, Max Martin, Ilya Salmanzadeh, and Oscar Görres amongst others, Eternal Sunshine is a pop and R&B record with dance, synth-pop and house influences, characterized by mid-tempo synthesizers, subtle guitar and string elements.
Grande derived the album's title from the 2004 American film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. She conceived the album as a record of both vulnerability and entertainment, inspired by her personal life experiences. Upon release, the album received acclaim from critics for its restrained vocals and music, and the emotional vulnerability of the subject matter, while some critiqued the songwriting as unrefined. Eternal Sunshine and its singles were nominated for three Grammy Awards, including for Best Pop Vocal Album.
In the United States, the album opened at number one on the Billboard 200, marking her sixth number-one on the chart, while charting all of its tracks on the Billboard Hot 100. Three singles were released from the album; the first two, "Yes, And?" and "We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)", debuted atop the Hot 100, making Grande the woman with the most number-one debuts and the first woman with two albums to produce multiple number-one debuts in the US. Eternal Sunshine topped the record charts in thirteen other countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Grande promoted and discussed the album on programs hosted by Zach Sang, Zane Lowe, Penn Badgley, and Sean Evans, and was the musical guest of Saturday Night Live on March 9, 2024. She performed music from the album at the 2024 Met Gala and on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.
The standard edition of Eternal Sunshine does not contain guest musical acts, but features spoken words from Grande's maternal grandmother Marjorie Grande on "Ordinary Things" and astrologer Diana Garland on "Saturn Returns Interlude". Two extended editions of the album, including remixes and versions of several tracks from the standard album, were released on March 10 and October 1, 2024.

# Background

On May 12, 2022, 19 months after the release of her sixth studio album, Positions (2020), Ariana Grande clarified that she would not be recording another album until she is done filming Wicked (2024), the film adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name, in which she portrays the character Glinda. In October 2023, she first jokingly hinted at a forthcoming album by posting "ag7: goat mother" as an Instagram caption [3]. A set of pictures included a photo of her with Swedish producer and long-time collaborator Max Martin at Jungle City Studios in New York City [4]. On December 7 and December 17, 2023, Grande shared a series of pictures and video clips working in recording studios and her editing audio files. As opposed to previous eras, she specifically stated that there would be no song snippets for the upcoming record [6]. On December 27, 2023, the singer confirmed a 2024 album release via her social media [7]. She posted a carousel of videos on her Instagram that show her crying in a recording studio and her mother Joan dancing to a new song of hers, amongst others [8]. She captioned the post "See you next year" and tagged several accounts, including Swedish musician Ilya Salmanzadeh, music video director Christian Breslauer, and Republic Records [9]. She referred to the picture of her crying and another one which depicts her dancing as the "two moods of the album" [10] [11]. Packages with R.E.M [11]. Beauty's On Your Collar lipstick in the shade "Attention" including a defocused close-up shot of Grande's red lips and the caption of an Instagram post she would make a few days after delivery, were sent to fans. On January 17, 2024, Grande announced the album, its title Eternal Sunshine, and release date via her social media [12] [10]. 

# Conception

Grande described Eternal Sunshine as "kind of a concept album" comprising "different heightened pieces of the same story, of the same experience". She explained that the record spans from "really vulnerable" songs to playful tracks which see her emulating "what people kind of expect me to be sometimes and having fun with it" [14]. Wendy Goldstein, co-president of Republic Records, described the record as an "elevated version" of Grande's previous albums, calling it an embodiment of "Sweetener meets  [...] Thank U, Next" [14]. 

# Recording and production

In a video shared to her social media of her previewing some songs of the album to Republic Records personnel, Grande revealed that after the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike forced the filming of Wicked to be paused temporarily, she "came  [to the studio]" and begun work on the record that September. She further revealed that she worked with Max Martin for a few weeks, and handled production on her own as well [1]. "Proper" vocal recordings and orchestrations were arranged in November [1]. Work on the album concluded in late December 2023 [2]. Referring to the period of making Eternal Sunshine, Grande stated that "things  [were] kind of just pouring out and happening very quickly" [8]. 

# Music and lyrics

Eternal Sunshine is a pop and R&B album  that features elements of dance music, especially synth-pop and house music [35]. Helen Brown of The Independent described it as a "slow-fizz pop" album, consisting of mid-tempo synths, strings and muted guitar [33] [19]. Jem Aswad of Variety felt that Martin and Salmanzadeh imbued the album with a "very Swedish vibe and structure to the tracks" inspired by classic pop, a style atypical of Anglo-American musicians [20]. Lyrically, the album is a combination of both "ultra-confident and entirely self-deprecating" themes, inspired by Grande's personal relationships [21]. Billboard described it as an introspective record—one in which Grande reflects on herself as she enters her thirties [22]. 

## Songs

Eternal Sunshine begins with the opening track, "Intro (End of the World)", which primarily includes strings and a morose guitar. The song begins with Grande posing the question, "How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship?", describing her anxieties with her partner, and the possibility of its end [19]. The second song, "Bye", was described by Grande as the hardest song on the album for her to write, saying "It was hard for the reason that I desperately didn't want it to sound like a 'fuck you.' I wanted it to sound like, 'I need to leave, so bye'" [23]. Grande wanted the song to have a sense of self-awareness and accountability, rather than being completely dismissive [24]. It is an uptempo dance-pop number with influences of disco and Philadelphia soul [25]. The third track, "Don't Wanna Break Up Again", is a gloomy, '90s influenced pop and R&B song that discusses conflicting feelings Grande has towards the end of her relationship with her partner [129] [33]. While referring to her relationship as a "situationship" that she's aware needs to end, the song shows a reluctancy to go through with ending the marriage and describes the steps she went through to try to save it, i.e [19]. therapy. Rolling Stone described the first three tracks of the album as "seventies pop" [20]. The album's interlude, "Saturn Returns", prominently samples a YouTube video of astrologer Diana Garland, as she discusses the importance of the age of 29 in a person's life. She urges the listener to "wake up" and "sort out who you really are" before the album's fifth and title track. The interlude fades directly into "Eternal Sunshine", during which Ariana seems to come to terms with the faults of her partner and their relationship. In the track, she hints that her ex-husband, Dalton Gomez may have cheated during their relationship and displays an uncertainty towards her future over an "R&B-pop" beat. "Supernatural", the sixth track on the album, has a low-tempo beat [33] [131]. The lyrics are about how Grande is in love with someone and is inseparable. Grande lets this love take over her entire state of mind. The lyrics also show that Grande is healing from heartbreak and is ready to love again. Billboard ranked "Supernatural" number 8 out of Eternal Sunshine, and compared it to "Breathin'" from Sweetener, as both songs are "undeniable home runs and surefire pure-pop smashes." [30] [19]. The seventh track, "True Story", and eighth track, "The Boy Is Mine", were intentionally placed together in the track list and are both described as R&B songs echoing music from the '90s and 2000s. The former is described by Grande as "an untrue story based on all untrue events" and sees her address the press who create rumors and "pray for her demise" for fun [31] [33]. It is a mid-tempo R&B track with a "slinky bounce" and elements of G-funk in its production. The latter song is a "bass-heavy" R&B song with lyrics about being infatuated with a man Grande believes she is destined to be with [34] [35]. It was inspired by the positive reactions received from the leaked track, "Fantasize", by her fans. The song is an "elevated version of the leak" and also a "reimagining" of the 1998 song of the same name. The ninth track and lead single of the album, "Yes, And?" is an uptempo and "effervescent" pop-house song with elements of ballroom in its production [58] [37]. Following "Yes, And?" is the tenth track, "We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)", which served as the album's second single [38]. The synth-wave influenced synth-pop song has been described as having a double meaning, with Grande speaking about a past lover, as well as her relationship with the press. "I Wish I Hated You" is a vulnerable and honest ballad that sees Grande confessing that she wishes her partner was worse to her in order for her to find closure and move on [39]. The eleventh track features a minimalistic electro-pop production. The penultimate track "Imperfect For You" describes two people who are in love, despite their imperfections [19]. The last track, "Ordinary Things" is about how when one is in love nothing feels ordinary. The track features Grande's grandmother, Marjorie Grande, who appears in the spoken-word outro.

The first was in the opening scene of the music video of the lead single, "Yes, And?". It depicts a red card that has the acronym "AG7" on the frontside, with the geographical coordinates 41.0359° N, 71.9545° W mentioned below it—which locate Montauk, New York, a key location of the film.

Seven cover variants of Eternal Sunshine were issued: a standard vinyl cover, four DTC variations via Grande's website, a retail-exclusive CD cover (which also serves as the "Yes, And? single artwork), and a Target-exclusive in the United States.

# Critical reception

On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score out of 100 to ratings from professional publications, Eternal Sunshine received a weighted mean score of 84, based on 19 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". In a rave review, Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone commended Eternal Sunshine for having "some of the most honest and inventive music of her career" and dubbed the album as an "instant classic" [125]. Various other critics, such as NME's Nick Levine,  AllMusic's Neil Z [33] [35]. Yeung,  Clash's Emma Harrison,  The Guardian's Laura Snapes,  and The New York Times' Lindsay Zoladz, dubbed it one of Grande's stronger, most sophisticated albums yet, highlighting the perceived maturity of its subject matter [126] [127] [129]. The album's musical tonality was often complimented. Harry Tafoya of Pitchfork,  Moses Jeanfrancois of Beats Per Minute,  Jem Aswad of Variety,  and Mary Siroky of Consequence emphasized Grande's "raw", subtle and restrained vocals, which they thought focused on texture instead of showcasing her vocal range [131] [134] [21]. Zoladz regarded Eternal Sunshine one of Grande's "texturally consistent" releases [22]. In contrast, Helen Brown of The Independent found this tone rather conversational, lacking "strong melodic snags" [133]. A number of critics offered criticism on the album's songwriting. Poppie Platt of The Daily Telegraph and David Cobbald of The Line of Best Fit regarded the album a "slickly" produced pop record, albeit with some underwhelming tracks and simple lyrics. According to Tafoya, Grande often settles for "stock phrases or scrambles for syllables",  while Siroky observed a lack of conceptual focus in the lyrics,  and Green claimed some tracks to be insubstantial [128] [130] [131] [22]. In an unfavorable review, Robert Sona of Sputnikmusic blamed the songwriting for making the album an "unambitious" output [135]. Several reviews praised Martin's production, emphasizing his stylistic influence on Eternal Sunshine. Sona credited Grande's "concise" team of producers—Martin, Salmanzadeh and Davidior—for helping the album feel like "a singular and shapely work of art" unlike Positions [20] [33] [129] [128]. Jeanfrancois considered the sound a return to 1990s' R&B, "something that has been avidly requested" by fans and critics [136]. However, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani agreed with Platt in critiquing the album for not venturing outside Grande's familiar music styles [134]. Eternal Sunshine's perceived status as a "divorce album" sparked a critical debate. Snapes described the album as a perceptive, "post-divorce" record. Tafoya opined Eternal Sunshine is not "as cohesive of a divorce record" as Adele's 30 (2021),  whereas Jeanfrancois said it is "by no means a divorce album" [129] [131].
