The_Voice_(American_TV_series)_season_26

The twenty-sixth season of the American reality television series The Voice premiered on September 23, 2024, on NBC. The season is hosted by Carson Daly, who returns for his twenty-sixth season. The coaching panel consists of Reba McEntire, who returns for her third season; returning coach Gwen Stefani, who returns for her eighth season after a one-season hiatus; and debuting coaches Michael Bublé and Snoop Dogg.
Sofronio Vasquez was named the winner of the season, marking Michael Bublé's first win as a coach, with Bublé becoming the fourth new coach, after Kelly Clarkson, John Legend, and Niall Horan to win on his debut season. With Vasquez's win, Bublé became the first coach in the history of the show to have the top two artists on his team on his debut season. Additionally, Vasquez became the first foreign male winner, as well as the second winner of Asian descent to win, following Tessanne Chin in the fifth season. This was the fifth, and second consecutive, season in the history of the show that a coach (Bublé) had the top two artists on their team, following Blake Shelton in seasons 3, 18, and 22, and Reba McEntire in the previous season.

# Overview

## Development

On May 10, 2024, NBC announced that The Voice was renewed for a twenty-sixth season to air in the fall of that year. On May 13, the lineup of coaches was unveiled at the network's upfront presentation for the 2024–25 United States network television schedule at Radio City Music Hall in New York City [1]. 

## Coaches and host

Of the four coaches that participated in the previous season, only Reba McEntire returned, marking her third season as a coach. Coaches Chance the Rapper, Dan + Shay, and John Legend all departed the panel for the season [3]. The latter two coaches both cited their ongoing concert tours as reasons for their departure. Former coach Gwen Stefani returns to the show following her absence in the previous season, marking her eighth season as a coach. Canadian singer-songwriter Michael Bublé and rapper Snoop Dogg join the coaching panel for their first seasons,  marking the first time since season 23 in which two coaches were introduced in a season [6] [9]. Both new coaches previously appeared on the show: Bublé previously served as a battle advisor for Team Blake on season 3,  while Snoop Dogg served as a mega mentor on season 20 during the Knockouts [8]. With Bublé's debut, he becomes the first Canadian to serve as a coach on the American adaptation of The Voice [9] [10]. Carson Daly returns for his twenty-sixth season as host.. 

## Mega mentors

On November 4, 2024, it was announced that former coach Jennifer Hudson would serve as a mega mentor for the Knockouts alongside English musician Sting. Hudson mentored Teams Bublé and Reba, while Sting was paired with Teams Gwen and Snoop. This marks the first season to feature two mega mentors in the Knockouts [12]. For the fourth consecutive season, there were no guest advisors in the battles, meaning the artists were solely mentored by their coaches.. 

## Marketing and promotion

Ahead of the season's premiere, on July 26, the show, via its online media platforms, released a cover of the 1966 Four Tops single "Reach Out I'll Be There" performed by the coaches. On September 23, hours before the premiere, the show released a cover of the coaches performing the 1979 Eagles hit, "Heartache Tonight" [13]. Shortly prior to the season premiere, the blind audition of Sofronio Vasquez, performing Mary J. Blige's "I'm Goin' Down", was released online. 

# Blind auditions

The show began with the Blind Auditions on September 23, 2024. In each audition, an artist sings their piece in front of the coaches, whose chairs face the audience. If a coach is interested in working with the artist, they may press their button to face the artist. If only one coach presses the button, the artist automatically becomes part of their team. If multiple coaches turn, they will compete for the artist, who will decide which team they will join. Each coach has one "block" to prevent another coach from getting an artist. This season, each coach ends up with 14 artists by the end of the blind auditions, creating a total of 56 artists advancing to the battles. This season, a new feature was introduced, dubbed the "Coach Replay." This addition allows each coach to press their button one time in the span of the blind auditions for an artist that was originally eliminated with no coaches turning. The artist is subsequently defaulted to that team. The recipients of this feature for each team were Kendall Eugene for Team Reba, Gail Bliss for Team Snoop, Jaylen Dunham for Team Gwen, and Mark Shiiba for Team Bublé, respectively. With Michael Bublé having four 4-chair turn contestants, he tied with Camila Cabello and Reba McEntire in which a debuting coach has the most 4-chair turns in their season.. In addition, Gwen Stefani received the most 4-chair turns during a single season in her eight seasons as a coach, with a total of six, which is also the most 4-chair turns a female coach received in all 26 seasons of the show.. 

## Episode 2 (September 30)

Among this episode's auditionees was Felsmere, who previously competed on the first season under her real name, Kelsey Rey, as part of Team CeeLo until her elimination in the battle rounds. Felsmere's reappearance marked the first time that a former contestant, who advanced to the battles, returned to compete in a later season as a solo artist, as well as the second returnee overall, after season 16 contestant Jej Vinson, who returned as part of the trio Sheer Element in season 23 . 

## Episode 3 (October 7)

Among the episode's auditionees was Jeremy Beloate, who previously competed on the eleventh season of America's Got Talent as part of the vocal group OneVoice, until their elimination in the Judge Cuts.. 

## Episode 4 (October 8)

Among this episode's auditionees was Sloane Simon, who previously competed on the nineteenth season of American Idol. 

## Episode 5 (October 14)

Among this episode's auditionees was Camryn Brooks, who previously auditioned unsuccessfully in season 21,  and Eliza Pryor, who previously competed on the seventeenth season of America's Got Talent as part of the act Acapop!, and played Valeria in the TV show Team Kaylie. [25]. 

## Episode 6 (October 15)

Among this episode's auditionees was Cassidy Lee, who previously auditioned unsuccessfully in season 18. 

# Battles

The second stage of the show, the battles, aired from October 21, 2024, to November 4, 2024, consisting of episodes 7 through 11. In this round, the coaches pitted two of their artists in a singing match and then select one of them to advance to the next round. For the fourth consecutive season, there were no guest advisors for the battles, which meant the artists were mentored solely by their coaches.. This season’s battle rounds are similar to season 24; losing artists may be "stolen" by another coach, becoming new members of that coach's team. Multiple coaches can attempt to steal an artist, resulting in a competition for the artist, who will then decide which team to join. Each coach has two steals to use this round. At the end of this round, nine artists will remain on each team; seven will be the battle winners, while the other two are stolen from another coach. In total, 36 artists advanced to the knockouts. 

# Knockouts

The third stage of the show, the knockouts, aired from November 11 to November 18, consisting of episodes 12 through 14. Jennifer Hudson served as mega mentor for Teams Bublé and Reba, and Sting served as mega mentor for Teams Gwen and Snoop. In the round, each coach groups three of their artists in a singing match. The artists themselves will select the song they will sing in the round, and then their coach selects one of them to advance to the playoffs.. This season's Knockout rounds are once again similar to seasons 22 and 24. Throughout the round, each coach can steal one losing artist from an opposing team and save one of their artists. At the end of the round, 12 artists win their knockout, remaining on their teams, while four artists are stolen, and four are saved by their respective coaches. Unlike season 24, however, there are no super saves. In all, a total 20 artists advanced to the playoffs. Two contestants withdrew from the show this round. In episode 12, Tanner Frick from Team Bublé withdrew from the show; leaving a two-way-knockout between Cameron Wright and Sloane Simon. In episode 14, Mor Ilderton from Team Gwen withdrew from the show, leaving a two-way-knockout between Jan Dan and Sydney Sterlace.. With two artists withdrawing in this season, this marks the first time to feature multiple artists withdrawing in one season.. 

# Playoffs

The fourth stage of the show, the playoffs, aired from November 19 to November 26, consisting of episodes 15 through 17. The top 20 artists perform for the coaches with a song of their choosing. At the end of the round, each coach selects two of their artists to advance, creating a total of 8 artists advancing to the live shows, just like season 23.. Like season six, season 13, season 23, season 24, and the previous season, the playoffs were not contested live. They were prerecorded and taped at the same stage as the prior two rounds, hence the lack of an interactive viewer voting component or a subsequent results episode. Team Gwen performed on the first episode, Teams Snoop and Reba performed on the second episode, and Team Bublé performed on the third episode.. Much like last season, this round features guest mentors, dubbed "playoff advisors", for each team. The advisors are Carly Pearce for Team Bublé, Machine Gun Kelly for Team Gwen, Lainey Wilson for Team Reba, and Simone Biles for Team Snoop.. 

# Live shows

## Week 1: Top 8 – Semi-finals (December 2–3)

For the first time this season, the Top 8 each performed a solo song and a Sting or The Police duo with a fellow semifinalist on Monday, with the results following on Tuesday. Mega mentor Sting returned to perform bass for the duets. The four artists with the most votes automatically moved on to the finale, while the remaining four artists competed in the Instant Save for the fifth and final spot in the finale.. With the advancements of Sofronio Vasquez, Shye, and Jeremy Beloate, Michael Bublé and Snoop Dogg became the eleventh and twelfth new coaches to successfully bring their team to the finale, the first being Usher (Michelle Chamuel in the fourth season), the second being Alicia Keys (Wé McDonald in the eleventh season), the third being Kelly Clarkson (Brynn Cartelli in the fourteenth season), the fourth being John Legend (Maelyn Jarmon in the sixteenth season), the fifth being Nick Jonas (Thunderstorm Artis in the eighteenth season), the sixth being Camila Cabello (Morgan Myles in the twenty-second season), the seventh Chance the Rapper (Sorelle in the twenty-third season), the eighth Niall Horan (Gina Miles also in the twenty-third season), the ninth Reba McEntire (Ruby Leigh and Jacquie Roar in the twenty-fourth season), and the tenth Dan + Shay (Karen Waldrup in the twenty-fifth season). With the advancement of Sydney Sterlace, Gwen Stefani successfully brought an artist to the finale by a public vote in a season that is not dependent upon team quotas for the first time. This is the first season since season 23 that all four coaches are represented in the finale, and only the second season in history that both first-time coaches have an artist in the finale (the first two being Chance the Rapper and Niall Horan). It is the second time in The Voice history since season 24 that all the finalists was originally a four-chair turn in Blind Auditions, and a first-time coach (in this case, Michael Bublé) has two artists competing in the finale, after McEntire.. 

## Week 2: Finale (December 9–10)

The season finale ran through two nights, Monday and Tuesday, December 9 through 10, 2024, comprising episodes 20 and 22. The Top 5 performed on Monday, with each artist performing an up-tempo song and a ballad for the title of The Voice. At the episode's conclusion, the overnight voting for the season's winner began. The following night, on Tuesday, the finalists performed a duet with their respective coaches before the results of the public vote were announced, and the winner of the season was named.. Sofronio Vasquez was named the winner of the season, marking Michael Bublé's first win as a coach. Bublé became the fourth new coach to win the show on his first attempt, the third being Niall Horan, who won with Gina Miles in the twenty-third season, the second being John Legend, who won with Maelyn Jarmon in the sixteenth season, and the first being Kelly Clarkson, who won with Brynn Cartelli in the fourteenth season. In addition, with Sofronio Vasquez and Shye making the top two, Bublé also became the third coach to have the top two artists of the season, the second being Reba McEntire, who had the top two artists in the twenty-fifth season, and the first being Blake Shelton, who had the top two artists in the third, eighteenth, and twenty-second seasons. However, Bublé became the first coach to accomplish this on his first attempt as a coach..
