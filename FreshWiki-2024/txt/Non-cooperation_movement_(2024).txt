Non-cooperation_movement_(2024)

The non-cooperation movement, also known as the one-point movement, was a pro-democratic disinvestment movement and a mass uprising against the Awami League-led government of Bangladesh, initiated within the framework of 2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement. The sole demand of this movement was the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her cabinet. It was the final stage of the wider movement known as the Student–People's uprising or the July Revolution.
Although the movement was initially limited to the goal of reforming quotas in government jobs, it snowballed into a mass anti-government uprising after the deaths of several protesters. The movement was also fueled by ongoing socio-economic and political issues, including the government's mismanagement of the national economy, rampant corruption by government officials, human rights violations, allegations of undermining the country's sovereignty by Sheikh Hasina, and increasing authoritarianism and democratic backsliding.
On 3 August 2024, coordinators of the Anti-discrimination Students Movement announced a one-point demand for the resignation of the Prime Minister and her cabinet and called for "comprehensive non-cooperation". The following day, violent clashes broke out, resulting in the deaths of 97 people, including students. The coordinators called for a long march to Dhaka to force Hasina out of power on 5 August. That day, a large crowd of protesters made its way through the capital. At around 3:00 p.m. (UTC+6), Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India, her government's biggest ally. Widespread celebrations and violence occurred following her removal, while the military and President Mohammed Shahabuddin announced the formation of an interim government led by economist and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. Meanwhile, Indian media outlets were seen engaging in a widespread disinformation campaign aimed at destabilising Bangladesh, following Hasina's resignation and departure to India.

# Background

During the quota reform movement in 2024, participants—particularly students—faced resistance, mass arrests, and massacre and severe injuries at the hands of police and other security forces. Six coordinators of the Anti-discrimination Students Movement, who were leading the initial quota reform movement, were also detained and were forcefully made to announce the conclusion of the protests by the Detective Branch (DB) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP). These events and authoritarianism fuelled people's anger against the government. On the morning of 3 August, one of the movement coordinators, Asif Mahmud, stated in a Facebook post that they would start a "non-cooperation movement" against the government, saying that it would be similar to that of "March '71". In the afternoon, Prime Minister Hasina proposed talks with the protesters, saying that "The doors of Ganabhaban (her official residence) are open" [28]. The Anti-discrimination Students Movement previously called for day-long protest programmes on 3 August. After day-long protests, students and ordinary people gathered at the central Shaheed Minar area with protest marches from different parts of Dhaka. At around 5:30 p.m., Nahid Islam, one of the coordinators, addressed the assembled crowd at Shaheed Minar and announced that the movement's exclusive demand was the resignation of Hasina and her cabinet [30]. He also called for a comprehensive non-cooperation movement starting from 4 August     and announced that they had no plans to negotiate with the government [31] [32] [33] [34]. He added that "we were forcefully offered to sit in talks with the Prime Minister. But we protested against this proposal by going on a hunger strike in DB custody." [35]. 

## Activities

Directions of non-cooperation were outlined by the Anti-discrimination Students Movement coordinators on 3 August: [36]. 

# History

On 4 August, thousands of protesters gathered at the Shahbag intersection in the morning, obstructing it as a form of civil disobedience to demand the government's resignation. At least 97 people died nationwide in confrontations, shootings, and pursuits related to the Non-cooperation movement. Fourteen police officers were killed across the country, with 13 deaths occurring at the Enayetpur police station in Sirajganj. Another officer was killed in Eliotganj, Comilla. Twenty-seven police facilities were attacked and vandalized, and a hundred policemen were injured in these incidents, according to an official statement by the Bangladesh Police [38]. In Dhaka, unidentified individuals set fire to and damaged various vehicles, including cars, ambulances, motorcycles, and buses, at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University during the protests. Around 4.30 p.m., eleventh-grade student Golam Nafiz was shot by the police in Dhaka Farmgate area, whose photo of being taken to the hospital on rickshaw went viral on internet, creating high outrage by netizens [39]. By 12:00 p.m., users across the country reported internet inaccessibility [40]. The government ordered the closure of Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, and all other Meta-owned services, directing internet service providers to comply after 1:00 p.m [41]. Later, the Minister of Information and Broadcasting Mohammad A [42]. Arafat confirmed that some social media platforms were temporarily blocked to prevent the spread of rumors amid protests. An indefinite nationwide curfew was imposed starting at 6:00 p.m [43]. Additionally, all courts were also ordered to close indefinitely [44] [45]. The government declared a three-day general holiday starting from 5 August, during which banks will also remain closed. The Anti-Discrimination Students Movement confirmed their intention to march towards Dhaka on 6 August to demand the Prime Minister's resignation [47]. The Bangladesh University Teachers' Network proposed a framework for an interim government, suggesting it be composed of teachers, judges, lawyers, and representatives from civil society, reflecting the views of various civil and political groups for a democratic transition [48]. Asif Mahmud, a coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Students Movement, announced that their march to Dhaka had been rescheduled to 5 August, instead of 6 August. He called on protesters and civilians nationwide to march toward the capital and participate in civil disobedience. Several former Bangladesh Army officers, including former chief of staff Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan, held a press briefing urging soldiers to return to camps and refrain from getting involved in the political crisis or being used against civilians [50]. Retired Brig. Gen. M. Sakhawat Hossain stated that there was significant unease among the troops, which likely pressured the chief of army staff as soldiers were deployed and witnessing the events. Retired officers, including Brig. Gen. Mohammad Shahedul Anam Khan, defied the curfew on Monday and took to the streets, with Khan noting that the army did not intervene. In response to calls for a march to Dhaka, DMP Commissioner Habibur Rahman warned of zero tolerance, stating that legal action would be taken against curfew violators. The Anti-discrimination Students Movement rejected the curfew and encouraged everyone to march towards the Ganabhaban and Prime minister's office. Reports indicated Sheikh Hasina had been moved to a secure location. On the same day, up to 135 people, including 24 police officers, were killed during protests [55]. Same day, at around 3:00 p.m. (UTC+6), Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India. Widespread celebrations and violence occurred following her removal, while the military and President Mohammed Shahabuddin announced the formation of an interim government led by economist and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus [25]. 

# Outcome

## Resignation of Sheikh Hasina

On 5 August 2024, at around 3:00 p.m., Prime Minister Hasina resigned and fled the country on a helicopter with her sister, Sheikh Rehana, to India,     arriving in Delhi via Agartala [2] [24] [57] [3]. Although she intended to record a speech, she did not have the opportunity to do so. Reports indicated that in a meeting with security officials on 4 August, Hasina insisted on staying in power by using force against what she called "terrorists" [59]. However, military leaders warned her that the country would be approaching a civil war if they fired on the protesters. As she was determined to stay, the military leaders met her again on the next morning and concluded that her safety could no longer be guaranteed as protesters were soon to reach the Ganabhaban. Senior police officers had also warned her that their forces were running out of ammunition. She finally agreed to resign after talking to her close relatives. Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, later said that his mother had begun considering resignation as early as 3 August but was only convinced to do so by close relatives who had been approached by senior military and police officials, according to media reports. 

## Storming of Ganabhaban

Shortly after Sheikh Hasina's departure, at around 3:00 p.m., protesters breached the gates of the Ganabhaban and entered the Prime Minister's residence looting, vandalizing, and destroying numerous items, including furniture. They rummaged office files  and sat on her bed as well as her chair to take selfies [61] [62]. Some protesters ate food and stole live animals,   while others looted Hasina's luxury Dior suitcase and her sarees [63] [64] [65]. 

## Sheikh Hasina's departure

Reports indicated that Hasina, along with her sister Sheikh Rehana and senior Awami League official Salman F Rahman, fled Ganabhaban aboard a military helicopter before transferring to a C-130 Hercules aircraft of the Bangladesh Air Force. An internet blackout was enforced to hinder the tracking of her movements. Initial reports suggested Hasina's flight, carrying the callsign AJAX1431, would land in Agartala, in the Indian state of Tripura [59] [67]. AJAX1431 switched off its transponder at around 17:00 local time over Lucknow, rendering the aircraft untraceable. Shortly, she was reported to have landed at the Hindan Air Force Station in Ghaziabad, on the outskirts of the Indian capital New Delhi, and was reportedly received by the Indian National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval at the base. Her arrival in Delhi was subsequently confirmed by Indian Minister of External Affairs S [68] [69]. Jaishankar. Sheikh Hasina is living in a secret location within India under tight security [70]. Flightradar24 reported that her flight was, at one point, the most tracked flight worldwide, with other civilian aircraft traveling into and out of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka also being highly tracked. She is expected to proceed to London for her safe passage  and seek political asylum in the United Kingdom, where Rehana's eldest daughter, Labour Party MP Tulip Siddiq is Economic Secretary to the Treasury under the incumbent Prime Minister Keir Starmer, while her youngest daughter Azmina Siddiq works for Control Risks as a global risk analysis editor [71] [72]. However, such plans are believed to be on hold due to indications from the UK government that she would not receive legal protection from investigations into the violence in Bangladesh [73]. 

## Arrest of Awami League leaders

In addition to Sheikh Hasina, several figures associated with her administration and the Awami League fled or attempted to flee Bangladesh. This group included Hasan Mahmud, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, the former Minister of state for Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology, and Ziaul Ahsan, the former Director General of the National Telecommunication Monitoring Centre. All were detained at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on 6 August. On 7 August, two more Awami League leaders were arrested near the Darshana border checkpoint while trying to flee abroad [74] [75] [76]. On 13 August, Salman F Rahman, former Adviser for Private Industry and Investment to the Prime Minister, and Anisul Huq, former Minister for Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs, were arrested while attempting to flee by boat at Sadarghat [77]. On 28 August, former Minister of Commerce Tipu Munshi was arrested after a murder case was filed against him over the death of a protester in Rangpur [78]. On September 10, Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, the former Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Adviser to Hasina, was arrested by the DB in the Gulshan area [79]. On 14 August, the general secretary of Barguna district Awami League was arrested on charges of conspiring to foment unrest. This followed the emergence of a phone call recording on social media in which he appeared to be communicating with Sheikh Hasina, who was by then in India. On 16 August, Ramesh Chandra Sen, former Minister of Water Resources, was arrested in his residence in Thakurgaon Sadar Upazila [81]. On 19 August, former Minister of Social Welfare and Awami League joint secretary Dipu Moni was arrested in Baridhara [82]. On 24 August, Ishaque Ali Khan Panna, the former General Secretary of the Bangladesh Chhatra League, died from a heart attack while climbing a mountain in the Indian state of Meghalaya as part of his efforts to flee Bangladesh [83]. On 21 August, the interim government ordered the revocation of diplomatic passports issued to Sheikh Hasina as well as her ministers and MPs. On August 29, the interim government issued an ordinance revoking a 2009 law that granted special privileges to the family of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, including Sheikh Hasina [85]. Numerous local officials nationwide also deserted their posts following Sheikh Hasina's overthrow. This included the mayor of Khulna City Corporation, Talukder Abdul Khaleque, who along with most of the city's 41 councillors, went into hiding, leading to a paralysis of the city government's functions [87]. At least 323 municipal mayors, 495 Upazila Parishad chairs, 53 District Council chairs, and 12 city corporation mayors were subsequently removed from office by the interim government [88]. 

# Casualties and damages

## Reprisal attacks against Awami League supporters and police

On the day of Sheikh Hasina's resignation, protesters vandalized statues of her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the former president of Bangladesh, in Dhaka. They also set the Awami League's headquarters in Dhaka ablaze [90]. The vandalizing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's statues has been compared with that of Saddam Hussain's statue in Baghdad on 2003. Houses or businesses of several Awami League leaders and activists were attacked. [c] The Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre, operated by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's residence in Dhanmondi, where he and his family were assassinated by military personnel in 1975, known as Bangabandhu Memorial Museum, were burnt and ransacked by the demonstrators. Two pro-government television stations were also forced off-air after being torched by demonstrators,  including ATN Bangla [111] [112] [114]. The Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, which houses the Parliament of Bangladesh, was also stormed by protesters,  who took 40 weapons from the building's security [115] [116]. These were later returned by students. The house of the Chief Justice of Bangladesh was vandalized by rioters who climbed the walls [117]. Sheikh Rehana's residence in Gulshan, Dhaka, was also looted [93]. The Mujibnagar Memorial Complex in Meherpur was also vandalized, resulting in damage to 600 sculptures [25]. Incidents of vandalism were also recorded at the Bangladesh Shishu Academy, 22 branches of the Shilpakala Academy, and the Shasi Lodge and the Zainul Park in Mymensingh. The 19th-century Bir Chandra Public Library in Comilla was also looted and burned, leading to the loss of several rare books [118]. At least 232 people were reported to have been killed in the three days that followed Hasina's resignation. This included at least 29 officials of the Awami League and associated groups as well as their relatives [120]. An Awami League office in Chittagong was also set ablaze by miscreants [121]. Two vehicles of the BGB were set ablaze by the rioters and five were killed in clashes between BGB and demonstrators [93]. Jails in Satkhira and Sherpur districts were attacked, leading to prisoner escapes [122]. In Satkhira alone, 596 prisoners escaped, although more than 400 of them voluntarily returned within days [123] [124]. An Awami League leader in Satkhira was hacked to death along with four associates after fatally shooting three members of a crowd that attacked his residence [125]. An installation of Bangladesh Ansar and Village Defence Force was also vandalized and partially burnt [126]. Ansar retaliated by killing two demonstrators. In Bogra, a police station was attacked and an Awami League office was set ablaze [127]. A violent mob attacked Baniachang police station in Habiganj and set it ablaze [128]. Police retaliated killing six rioters. A total of 150 people, including police personnel were wounded in the incident. Six people were killed and more than a hundred wounded in Kushtia when police opened fire on rioters. Seven police stations were burnt and destroyed in Chittagong [130]. A demonstrator was fatally shot by the police in Manikganj, following the vandalism of a local police station [131]. Despite the peaceful nature of a victory march in Srimangal, police intervention resulted in injuries to more than a hundred participants [132]. In Jessore, at least 24 people, including an Indonesian national, were killed after a hotel belonging to a district leader of the Awami League was set on fire [133]. Two union council chairs were beaten to death by mobs in separate incidents in Khulna and Chandpur [134]. Clashes between BGB and demonstrators led to the deaths of six people, including a BGB soldier in Gazipur,  where a protest outside a jail also resulted in the escape of 209 inmates [135] [136] [137]. In Kishoreganj, a clash between Awami League leaders and activists led to the death of five individuals and left hundreds injured, including journalists [138]. Operations at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka were suspended for eight hours. The Higher Secondary Certificate examinations, which were originally scheduled for 11 August, had to be postponed [140]. This decision was made after the question papers suffered damage during the attacks on police stations. On 10 August, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) dismissed the head of its Bauphal upazila branch following complaints about his alleged involvement in the violence and looting. 

## Violence against minorities

Hindus were widely perceived as strong supporters of the Hasina regime. Hours after Hasina's departure, reports surfaced about attacks against Hindus in Bangladesh. Haradhan Roy, a Hindu councilor from the Awami League in Rangpur, and Mrinal Kanti Chatterjee, a Hindu school teacher in Dhaka were killed [143]. According to the Investigation conducted by Prothom Alo correspondents across 64 districts and 67 upazilas between 5–20 August 2024, 1,068 attacks on the minority community occurred in 49 districts [143] [144] [145]. Two members of the Hindu community were killed in the violence, and a total of 912 attacks were documented. Of these, in at least 506 cases, the victims were affiliated with Awami League. The Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council reported that from August 4 to August 20, a total of 2,010 incidents (including 69 temples) of attacks on minorities took place across the country within this 16-day period [146]. Among the incidents, homes of 157 families were vandalised, looted, and set on fire, while some of their businesses  were also attacked. According to most observers, the attacks were largely politically motivated where victims were primarily Awami League leaders, activists, and police. However, many Hindus with no political affiliation were also affected. The coordinators of the student movement denounced these attacks and urged the public not to participate in such violence [143] [26]. Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus attempted to flee to India after being attacked, however, they were turned back by the border guards from both countries. Indian Border Security Force (BSF) arrested nearly a dozen Bangladeshis who were trying to cross the border to escape the violence and political unrest [150] [151]. In Lalmonirhat, an Awami League leader was seen spreading rumors, urging local Hindus to gather at the border with India and engage with Indian leaders who were expected to arrive there [152]. Reportedly, he successfully assembled thousands of Hindus at the border before they were dispersed by the BGB and local police. Meanwhile, students and members of the Muslim community, including madrasa students, were seen standing guard at temples and churches to protect them. Chief adviser to the interim government, Muhammad Yunus, also denounced the violence, stating that there was no room for discrimination in Bangladesh [156] [151]. The interim government also assured that it would "immediately sit with the representative bodies and other concerned groups to find ways to resolve such heinous attacks" [157]. Similar reports of Islamists perpetrating violence against Ahmadiyyas  and vandalising tombs of Sufi saints    emerged in various parts of the country in midst of collapse of law and order [159] [160] [161] [162]. Reports of houses belonging to ethnic minorities like the Kurukh  and Chakma  being torched by mobs have also emerged. [163] [164]. 

# Disinformation by Indian media

Indian media outlets were disseminating disinformation regarding attacks on minorities in Bangladesh with an intent to destabilize the country after Hasina's departure. Sensationalist media outlets, especially those closely associated with the ruling party in India, the Bharatiya Janata Party, attempted to portray the mass uprising as an Islamist-backed military takeover of the country   purportedly orchestrated by India's rivals, Pakistan (through its intelligence agency) & China [26] [27] [165] [166]. Gobinda Pramanik, Former Secretary General of the Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance, criticized the Indian media, suggesting that they inaccurately portrayed the situation. Pramanik stated that the incidents of vandalism targeted only the homes of certain Awami League leaders, both Hindu and Muslim, who had a history of aggressive actions. He further noted that members of opposition parties, including the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami, were involved in protecting Hindu temples and homes from potential attacks. But the incumbent General Secretary of the group dismissed his statement as a lie,  claiming that he was expelled from the organisation and became the president of the same organisation again after the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government [172] [173] [174]. The organisation strongly condemned Pramanik's statement regarding the attacks and looting of places of worship [175] [176]. BNP leader Gayeshwar Chandra Roy also denied claims made by Indian media that his party is anti-Hindu, asserting that the BNP has been inclusive of all communities in Bangladesh and has consistently supported all religious groups. He highlighted his own role as a former minister in a BNP-led government and as a member of the party's highest decision-making body. Numerous India-based social media accounts circulated several misleading videos and images about attacks on Bangladeshi Hindus, using hashtags such as #AllEyesOnBangladeshiHindus and #SaveBangladeshiHindus, which were subsequently debunked by several fact-checking organizations. A false report also claimed that the house of Bangladeshi cricketer Liton Das had been set on fire, which was later debunked [27]. Das himself refuted the claim in a Facebook post [178] [179]. Several television news outlets also ran headlines falsely claiming that the violence constituted an "act of genocide" and a "pogrom", while an alleged arson attack on a Hindu temple was later found to have occurred at an adjacent Awami League office [180]. Quoting BJP leader and Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, several Indian media outlets falsely claimed that over 10 million Bangladeshi Hindus are fleeing to India for refuge, claiming that Bangladesh is turning into an "Islamic State". According to Bangladeshi political analyst Zahed Ur Rahman, Indian media viewed the situation in Bangladesh through "their Islamophobic eye", despite the view in Bangladesh that it was a popular movement. Analysts Farid Erkizia Bakht and Siddharth Varadarajan suggested that India's intent to destabilize Bangladesh through this disinformation campaign stems from the disappointment of losing a valuable ally like Sheikh Hasina and from apprehensions about the new government in the country harbouring anti-Indian sentiments. Disinformation about a "genocide on Hindus" was also spread by actors from outside the region, including by British anti-immigrant and anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson. 

# Aftermath

## Restoration of services

As per reports, broadband internet services were reinstated approximately at 1:00 p.m. on 5 August,  followed by the restoration of cellular internet access after 2:00 p.m [183]. However, access to social media platforms continued to be restricted [184]. The curfew was rescinded on 6 August, and offices, businesses, and schools were permitted to resume operations on the same day [185] [186]. 

## Interim government formation

On 5 August, the Chief of Army Staff, Waker-uz-Zaman, convened a meeting with representatives from BNP, Jatiya Party (Ershad), and Jamaat-e-Islami  and called for the creation of an interim government within 48 hours, excluding the Awami League [188]. Several subsequent reports indicated that Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus had been approached to be the head of the interim government by the student protesters [189]. Other possible names for the head of government included Salahuddin Ahmed, a former governor of Bangladesh Bank, retired General Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, and lawyer Sara Hossain. The nomination of Yunus, who accepted the advisory role in the interim government, has also been supported by prominent figures within the student movement [190]. In addition, Waker-uz-Zaman pledged an investigation by the military into the preceding incidents of violence and issued an order prohibiting security forces from opening fire on crowds [191]. President Mohammed Shahabuddin issued an order for the release of all students who had been detained during the protests, as well as Khaleda Zia, the former prime minister and chairperson of the BNP. Zia has been a long-standing political adversary of Sheikh Hasina [52]. This decision was made unanimously at a meeting attended by major opposition parties and the heads of the armed services. On 6 August, in response to an ultimatum from the student movement that warned of further demonstrations, Shahabuddin dissolved the Jatiya Sangsad [192]. Additionally, a reorganization was carried out within the Bangladesh Armed Forces,  while Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun was removed as Inspector General of the Bangladesh Police [193] [140]. Following a meeting with student leaders on 6 August, Shahabuddin formally appointed Yunus on 7 August as head of the interim government,  Yunus, who was in Paris, returned to Dhaka on 8 August  and was inaugurated later that day along with the rest of his cabinet at the Bangabhaban [194] [195] [196]. Among those who joined the interim government as advisers were two leaders of the student movement, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud [197] [198]. 

## Security crisis

Following the resignation of Sheikh Hasina, police were absent from their duties, leading to a surge in burglaries and thefts in residential areas of Dhaka. These incidents caused widespread panic among residents, who were compelled to guard their neighborhoods at night. Reports indicted the presence of robbers on 6 and 7 August [200]. During this time, banks and ATM booths were nearly out of cash due to the security crisis. In response, anti-robbery committees were established throughout the city [201]. Additionally, residents used social media platforms to prevent further burglaries [202]. Numerous weapons were also looted from police stations and security installations nationwide [203]. By 3 September, authorities had recovered at least 3,880 firearms, 286,353 rounds of ammunition, 22,201 tear gas shells, and 2,139 sound grenades. More than 500 prisoners set free by mobs during the violence also several banned terror outfit chiefs including ABT Chief Jashimuddin Rahmani released on Bail [204]. 

## Constitutional crisis

A constitutional crisis emerged on August 5, 2024, following Sheikh Hasina's resignation, because the existing constitution has no provisions for an interim government or any other form of government in the event that the prime minister resigns and the parliament is dissolved. Although Article 123 of the constitution mandates general elections within 90 days following the dissolution of parliament, no clear guidelines exist for the powers and structure of an interim government. Following the oath-taking of the interim government, student leader and ICT adviser Nahid Islam announced that a constituent assembly election would be held to draft and adopt a new constitution to resolve the crisis. The interim government also established a Constitutional Reform Commission to prepare a roadmap for the constituent assembly election.. 

# Prosecutions

On 13 August, former Awami League MP Nizam Uddin Hazari was named as a primary accused in a murder case related to the killing of an auto-rickshaw driver in Feni during the protests on 4 August. Approximately 400 other Awami League members and officials were also charged in this case, including Feni Sadar Upazila Chair Shusen Chandra Shil, the Awami League President in the upazila, and Feni Municipality Mayor Nazrul Islam Swapan Miazi. On 16 August, murder complaints were filed against former MPs Shahadara Mannan Shilpi, Talukdar Mohammad Towhid Jung Murad, and Mohammad Saiful Islam in connection with the deaths of students during protests on 5 August [207]. On 14 August, the father of a student killed during the protests filed a petition at the International Crimes Tribunal. The petition called for an investigation into charges of genocide and crimes against humanity against Sheikh Hasina and nine other individuals, including the General Secretary of Bangladesh Awami League and former Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader, and former Minister of Home Affairs Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal over their role in the crackdown on the protests. The Awami League and its associated organizations were also named as accused in the petition. A formal investigation was initiated by the court later that day,  and on 8 September, legal proceedings began to extradite Sheikh Hasina [210]. On 15 August, two additional murder charges were filed against Sheikh Hasina and several of her associates in connection with the deaths of two individuals during the protests [211]. On 19 August, Sheikh Hasina and 66 others were charged over the killing of a BNP ward leader in Dhaka North City Corporation during the protests on 4 August [212] [213]. On 21 August, journalists Shakil Ahmed and his wife, Farzana Rupa, from the pro-Hasina channel Ekattor TV, were arrested at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport while flying to board a flight to Paris. They were suspected of instigating the killing of a garment worker during a demonstration in Uttara, Dhaka, on 5 August. Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders expressed concern over their arrest. On 22 August, a United Nations (UN) team arrived in Bangladesh to discuss and understand the interim government's priorities for promoting human rights. A separate fact-finding team, to be dispatched later, will investigate human rights violations during the protests and unrest. On 23 August, charges were filed against former State Minister for Water Resources Zahid Farooq Shamim and at least 377 others for their role in an attack on the BNP office in Barisal on 5 August. 

# Reactions

## Domestic

Muhammad Yunus, who was in Paris undergoing a medical procedure at the time of Hasina's departure, hailed her resignation as Bangladesh's "second Independence Day". He also committed to returning to Bangladesh "without delay", responding affirmatively to a request from the student movement to guide the interim government [219]. In her first public address following her release, Khaleda Zia commended "the brave people who were in a do-or-die struggle to make possible the impossible". She emphasized the need for restraint and advocated for "love and peace" as essential in the process of rebuilding Bangladesh. Tarique Rahman, who is currently serving as the acting chair of the BNP and is based in London, declared that "Hasina's resignation is a testament to the power of the people"  and urged for "restraint" [197] [220]. On 7 August, during a rally in Dhaka, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Secretary General of BNP, called for the holding of fair elections within the next three months [140]. On 13 August, the BNP formally requested the UN to conduct an international investigation into the killings during the protests [221]. In a phone call with chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on 14 August, UN human rights chief Volker Türk said that such an investigation would come "very soon" [222]. Sajeeb Wazed, the son and adviser of Sheikh Hasina, initially announced on 5 August that his mother intended to retire from politics. On 7 August, he amended this statement clarifying that both Hasina and the Awami League would continue to be active in the political landscape of Bangladesh. He further mentioned that she would return to the country once elections were declared [196]. On 10 August, he claimed to Reuters that Hasina is still the Prime Minister as she did not get enough time to formally submit her resignation to the President, due to protesters advancing towards her official residence [224]. Later in an interview published on 14 August, he expressed that the stand of the fifth Hasina ministry on the quota system was wrong and they should have supported the protesters from the first [225]. On 11 August, in what is said to be her first statement published by the Indian media after her fleeing to the country, Sheikh Hasina confirmed that she resigned and conceded defeat to avoid further bloodshed. She attributed her decision to resign to pressure from the United States and urged Awami League supporters to keep their morale high. Shortly thereafter, Wazed refuted the statement as "completely false and fabricated," emphasizing that Hasina "did not make any statement before or after leaving Dhaka" [227]. On 12 August, the Rumor Scanner Bangladesh investigated the matter and declared the reports about Sheikh Hasina's statement as fake and rumour [228]. On 13 August, Hasina released her first confirmed statements since her overthrow, published by Wazed, calling for an investigation into the killings during the protests [229]. She also insisted that the police and the Awami League were victims of "terrorist aggression".
