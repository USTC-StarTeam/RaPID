2024_Bangladeshi_general_election

General elections were held in Bangladesh on 7 January 2024 in accordance with the constitutional requirement, stating that elections must take place within the 90-day period before the expiration of the current term of the Jatiya Sangsad on 29 January 2024. The Awami League, led by incumbent Sheikh Hasina, won the election for the fourth consecutive time with less than  10% of the eligible voters voting according to an Election Commission, which is run by the ruling political party. The party won 224 seats while independent candidates, most of whom were Awami League members propped up as dummy candidates to give a semblance of competition, won 62 seats.
In the lead-up to the election, the incumbent government led by Sheikh Hasina cracked down on opposition parties and silenced critics of the government. Hasina's prime ministership has been described as authoritarian since being re-elected in 2008, and in 2011 removed the requirement that a temporary independent caretaker government be formed to hold elections. The main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, boycotted the elections (as they did in 2014) as they assumed that the election commission under the incumbent government were unable to organise a free and fair election.
A protest over the election turnout emerged as the Chief Election Commissioner initially claimed, based on the data at hand, that turnout was 28%, but later retracted that statement to claim turnout was around 40%.
The United States Department of State, in a statement, said that the election was not free and fair and the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office termed the election lacking the preconditions of democracy. According to The Economist, through this election, Bangladesh effectively became a one-party state.
Later in August 2024, Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and the 12th Jatiya Sangsad was dissolved and was replaced by an interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus amidst popular student protests in the country. Early elections are expected to be called to elect a new Jatiya Sangsad.

# Background

The Awami League won the 2018 general elections and formed the government. The first session of the parliament sat on 30 January 2019 [23]. As the tenure of a parliament lasts five years in Bangladesh,  the Sangsad was scheduled to expire on 29 January 2024. [3]. The main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), demanded that the government hand over power to a neutral caretaker government before the next elections. This has been rejected by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who vowed that "Bangladesh will never allow an unelected government again" [24]. Hasina's resistance to a caretaker government arose following the 2006–2008 crisis, during which a caretaker government assumed military control of the country and arrested a number of political leaders, including Hasina and BNP leader Khaleda Zia [49]. Zia was sentenced to prison for five years on 8 February 2018, for her involvement in the Zia Orphanage corruption case [26]. The sentence was then modified to 10 years [27]. Khaleda Zia's successor as chair of the party, her son Tarique Rahman, was also found guilty of criminal conspiracy and multiple counts of murder for a grenade attack in 2004 that injured Hasina and killed 24 people [28]. He was sentenced to life in prison [29]. As such, he was barred from running for office. In order to guarantee that the election will be conducted in accordance with electoral law and the constitution, the 2024 Bangladesh Election Commission was formed on 27 February 2022. It is responsible for announcing election schedules, outlining constituency zones, preparing electoral rolls, supervising the elections, announcing the election's results, and establishing election boards to settle any election disputes [31]. It is chaired by Kazi Habibul Awal, Md [32]. Alamgir, Anisur Rahman, Rashida Sultana Emily and Ahsan Habib Khan. In the election, President Mohammed Shahabuddin and first lady Rebecca Sultana used a postal ballot to cast their vote on 3 January 2024. It is the first instances of using postal ballot in the history of elections in Bangladesh. 

# Electoral system

The 350 members of the Jatiya Sangsad consist of 300 directly elected seats using first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies, and an additional 50 seats reserved for women. The reserved seats are selected by the elected constituency members via the single transferable vote. Each parliament sits for a five-year term. 

## Criticism

The electoral system has been criticised as disproportional    and a key driver of political deadlock in the country [36] [37] [38]. 

# Pre-electoral statistics and information

According to the data released by the Election Commission on 4 January 2024, the total number of voters in the next parliamentary election is 119,689,289 people. Among them, 60,769,741 are men voters, 58,918,699 are women voters and 849 hijra voters. According to EC, 28 political parties and a total of 1,970 candidates are contesting the election, of which 436 are independent candidates [39]. Total final polling centres are 42,148 and final polling booths are 261,564. 

# Controversies

The BNP has demanded that there should be a caretaker government during election season because, as Citizens for Good Governance founder-secretary Badiul Alam Majumder has claimed, every election in Bangladesh that was not conducted under a caretaker government has been marred by irregularities. Without a caretaker government, the BNP has stated its intent to boycott the elections [42] [24]. On 17 May 2023, BNP standing committee member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said: " [Our] movement and elections cannot go hand in hand. Participating in elections under  [the current government] means to validate them. We cannot continue our movement with those who compete in the elections when the leaders and activists are being arrested and harassed while protesting to free the country from this illegal government. Rather, it is time to identify them and uproot them politically."  On 3 June 2023, the BNP expelled 43 of its leaders for life as a result of their decision to participate in the Sylhet City Corporation election [43]. Jamaat-e-Islami was banned from participating in elections in 2013, and many of its former leaders have gone on to form the Bangladesh Development Party (BDP), which intends to participate in the elections. The president of the BDP, Anwarul Islam Chan, has denied any affiliations with the Jamaat, saying: "The post-liberation generation was born after independence. We are a political party and not interested in such issues" as opposing Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. The Awami League, on the other hand, has insisted that a caretaker government would be unconstitutional and that the Election Commission is independent and sanctioned by law. The Bangladeshi Ministry of Foreign Affairs asserted "the electoral process will remain under strict vigilance, including by international observers as accredited by the Election Commission."  Bangladesh Foreign Minister Dr [51]. AK Abdul Momen said on 10 April 2023, in a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that the independent election commission is key to holding fair, transparent elections. 

# Foreign positions

## United States

The U.S. Department of State termed the election as not free and fair. The spokesperson of the State Department Mathew Miller said, "The United States shares the view with other observers that these elections were not free or fair and we regret that not all parties participated." [118]. 

## United Nations

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, expressed concern over Bangladesh's recent elections, citing violence and repression against opposition candidates and supporters. Türk urged the newly elected government, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, to address human rights concerns and enhance the foundations of an inclusive democracy. The statement highlighted arbitrary detentions, intimidation, enforced disappearances, and political violence in the lead-up to the elections. Türk called for independent investigations into reported incidents, emphasizing the need for fair and transparent trials for those responsible. He stressed the significance of preserving hard-won democracy in Bangladesh and called for comprehensive investigations into campaign-related violations and irregularities. 

## Others

On 7 May 2023, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland to send diversified election observers for the election while stating that her government has made the election commission an independent and powerful institution to strengthen the democratic process in the country. A group of human rights organizations wrote to 14 members of United States Congress urging them to be aware of how the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami have been operating "overtly and covertly in cahoots with terrorist groups, like Ansar al Islam, since 2001". Terry Isley, a member of an independent election monitoring delegation that visited Bangladesh in August 2023, said that the demand for a caretaker government is unconstitutional and illegal in the present political context of Bangladesh. He also expressed disappointment that the BNP refused to meet with the delegation. On 20 September 2023, the Election Commission of Bangladesh received a letter from the European Union stating that it would not send a full-fledged election observation mission to the upcoming general election. The letter said Bangladesh's environment is not suitable for election observation. However, in a letter to the Election Commission on 19 October the EU said it would send a 4-member technical team to observe the election [61] [62].

# Foreign observers

On 5 January 2024, at a meeting attended by heads of missions from about 90 countries, Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary, Masud Bin Momen, invited foreign envoys to be part of the international team of observers for its general elections scheduled for 7 January 2024. A total of 127 observers from various countries,  were present for these polls, including members from the European Union, The Commonwealth,  the South Asia Democratic Forum (SADF), the US-based  International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI) and American Global Strategies (AGS); UK-based Conservative Commonwealth Association and other reputable organizations [72]. After the vote on 7 January 2024, this election drew mixed reactions among international observers. Representatives of many international team of observers acknowledged that this election was conducted free and fairly and praised the role and efficiency of present Bangladesh Election Commission. Alexander Barton Gray, CEO of American Global Strategies (AGS) said "Considering the overall situation, all the observers present here agree that the 12th National Parliament Election of Bangladesh was held peacefully and with the participation of the common people". The CEO of the Central Election Commission of Palestine, Hisam M.Y Kuhail, made remarks during a media briefing in Dhaka [74]. "The voting process in all the centers that we visited was very quiet and peaceful," Kuhail said. "The people of your country should be proud of holding such a peaceful election." When asked about the voter turnout, Kuhail avoided the question, stating, "We are here to judge the voting process, whether voters were allowed access to the polls or whether voting took place systematically. The governments of the United States of America and Canada had separately confirmed, through official statements, that they did not deploy any election observers with their authority to monitor Bangladesh's national elections held on January 7. Despite that, a group of international observers were present at their own effort. However, some USA, UK based  international team of observers expressed the views that this election was not free or fair [81]. Local media in Bangladesh reported that the Hasina government lined up their supporters near polling stations when cameras and foreign election observers were near and had them disperse immediately afterwards [77] [78]. However, some election observers did report a peaceful environment at the polling stations on the day of the elections [8]. 

# Violence

Election Commission Secretary Jahangir Alam has told that Mostafizur Rahman Chowdhury's candidacy has been cancelled for violating election norms and for threatening "law enforcement officials" just before polling officially closed. He was charged for these types of allegations in past too.
