Chromakopia

Chromakopia is the eighth studio album by American rapper Tyler, the Creator. It was released through Columbia Records on October 28, 2024, serving as the follow-up to Call Me If You Get Lost (2021). Chromakopia was written, produced, and arranged by Tyler himself. The album features guest appearances from Daniel Caesar, Doechii, GloRilla, LaToiya Williams, Lil Wayne, Childish Gambino, Solange, Lola Young, Santigold, Schoolboy Q, Sexyy Red, Thundercat, and Teezo Touchdown, with physical releases of the album additionally featuring Playboi Carti.
The album blends different genres like hip-hop, jazz, and soul, evocative of Tyler's previous releases Flower Boy (2017) and Igor (2019). Conceptually, Chromakopia is narrated by Tyler's mother, Bonita Smith, as a diary that pieces together Tyler's perspective on past timeline experiences separated by tracks. The album received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the lyricism, cohesiveness, and production, and even noted its messy and confusing nature as a positive.
Chromakopia was supported by the singles "Noid" and "Sticky", as well as two promotional singles, from "St. Chroma" and "Thought I Was Dead". The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one in eight countries. In the United States, the album debuted at the top of the Billboard 200, earning Tyler his third US number-one album and is his fastest-selling album to date. Several other songs from the album also charted on the Billboard Hot 100, such as "Noid" and "St. Chroma". In support of the album, Tyler will embark on the Chromakopia: The World Tour (2025).

# Background and recording

On October 28, 2024, during Tyler, the Creator's Chromakopia exclusive listening event, Tyler revealed the meaning behind the album, noting that the album was originally about him growing up in Hawthorne, Inglewood. He revealed on stage that "no one knows anything about me from before I was like 17" and that the record turned into Tyler "taking a bunch of shit my mom told me as a kid."  Tyler uploaded a video on his official YouTube channel titled "MASK IS OFF: CHROMAKOPIA" on November 12, 2024, which chronicles the creative process of the album, including behind-the-scenes clips from composition sessions, instrumentation arrangements and engineering work [6]. 

# Composition

## Music

Primarily a hip-hop, R&B, and jazz album, Chromakopia embraces eclectic instrumentation. It blends musical styles reminiscent of Tyler's fourth and fifth albums Cherry Bomb (2015) and Flower Boy (2017), such as neo soul melodies and synthesizer-based arrangements [8]. Military cadences and soulful elements are also present on the album [8]. This is Tyler's first album since his second studio album Goblin to not have the 10th track on the album feature multiple titles [9]. 

## Themes and lyrics

Chromakopia is narrated by Tyler's mother, Bonita Smith. Its concept was inspired by his experience growing up in Greater Los Angeles and the life lessons he learned from Smith as a child, that he began to understand and appreciate as he grew older [11]. Before the album's release, publications speculated that the album could be based on the story of Chroma the Great, a powerful conductor whose orchestra creates the colors of the world, from the 1961 children's novel The Phantom Tollbooth [12]. Dork's Jake Hawkes notes the character ties into the album's aesthetics, but has little impact on the lyrical material [13]. Music critics characterized Chromakopia as an early midlife crisis album revolving around the concerns young adults have over their newfound adulthood [14]. Its protagonist, St. Chroma, is introduced on the opening track of the same name. Smith describes him as the light and tells him to never dim his light for anyone. "Rah Tah Tah" features braggadocious lyrics, as Tyler declares himself as the biggest rapper from Los Angeles after Kendrick Lamar [18]. "Noid", on the other hand, explores his anxieties with celebrity culture and parasocial relationships [14]. In "Darling, I", featuring vocals by Teezo Touchdown, Tyler reflects on his artistic ambition and the practice of monogamy [19]. Titled after the abortion-related healthcare company, "Hey Jane" stages a conversation between Tyler and an anonymous, older woman in the wake of an unplanned pregnancy. Billboard's Mackenzie Cummings-Grady wrote that on the record, Tyler "speaks on his consuming paranoia" while narrating his "desire for children" [20]. 

# Release and promotion

Provoked by Beyoncé's surprise release of her 2013 self-titled album,  the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) changed the day of the week when music is released worldwide from Tuesday to Friday [22]. Tyler criticized the industry standard in a 2023 interview with Nardwuar, suggesting that it promotes "passive listening" [23]. He chose to release Chromakopia on Monday, October 28, 2024, at 6 a.m. ET [24]. Trucks and shipping containers promoting Chromakopia were spotted in various cities across the U.S., including Tyler, Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Charlotte, Columbus, Philadelphia, Roswell, Phoenix, Hawthorne (Tyler's hometown), and Los Angeles. Shortly after the video for "St [26] [27] [28]. Chroma" released, the phone number +1 (855) 444–8888, which was previously used as promotion for Call Me If You Get Lost, was changed to a voicemail concerning the "Chromakopia Trucking Company", where a voice said that all the company's drivers were unavailable and to call later. One day before its release, Tyler held an album listening party at Intuit Dome. 

## Singles

On October 16, 2024, Tyler posted a teaser for Chromakopia's opening track, "St. Chroma", on his social media accounts. He revealed the album's name, release date, and cover art the following day [29]. The album's lead single, "Noid", was released on October 21 [30] [31]. The following single, "Sticky" featuring GloRilla, Sexyy Red, and Lil Wayne, was released to rhythmic contemporary radio stations on November 12 [32] [33]. A teaser for its eleventh track, "Thought I Was Dead", was shared on October 26 [34]. Three more songs were teased in a promotional video for the album's limited edition vinyl [35] [36]. 

## Tour

Chromakopia: The World Tour was announced on October 23, 2024, with additional shows announced October 29, 2024. Promoted by AEG Presents, the tour will feature special guests Lil Yachty and Paris Texas, with 53 dates across North America, including the U.S [38]. and Canada, 24 dates in Western Europe and the UK, and 12 shows scheduled in Oceania, covering Australia and New Zealand. The tour will take place throughout 2025. 

# Critical reception

According to the review aggregator Metacritic, Chromakopia received "universal acclaim" based on a weighted average score of 85 out of 100 from 17 critic scores. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 7.9 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus [5]. Reviewing the album for AllMusic, David Crone claimed that, "Chromakopia is less of a cohesive statement than Tyler's fans are used to hearing; it's erratic and candid at once, a strange pressure cooker of boasts and doubts that falls out of step with its deftly sequenced and thematically tight predecessors."  Writing for Clash, Niall Smith wrote that "the project's mid-section advances the album's winning streak", however, "while there aren't any outright weak tracks" on the record, occasionally, "the pacing feels slightly less focused than Tyler's previous work" [41]. Smith concluded that "while some elements feel a bit safe, the sound design is chiseled and sharper" while noting that the album showcases Tyler's "now-mastered style in HD glory". Consequence's Jonah Krueger wrote that "the maternal presence is felt throughout the tracklist" and that Tyler " [explores] his anxieties and trauma" throughout the record [42]. Writing for Dork, Jake Hawkes noted that Chromakopia is a project "that bulges at the seams" and that "Tyler somehow wrangles it into something cohesive" [43]. Hawkes continued, "lyrically, Tyler seems at his most confessional in years", before concluding, stating that the album "has depth, it has worldbuilding, but just as importantly, it has some absolute bangers, too". The Guardian's Alexis Petridis wrote that "tracks shift and slip their moorings, lurching from one sound to another" and that often, they change "completely over the course of a few minutes". Petridis concluded that "Chromakopia ultimately seems to manifest a state of confusion, in which everything is in flux and nothing is quite as it initially seems". Steven Loftin for The Line of Best Fit wrote that "Chromakopia's execution has been well thought out and finessed", however, "it is messy and it is truthful" [16]. Loftin expressed that the album "continues piecing together the Tyler, the Creator puzzle without making the picture any clearer". Tom Breihan, writing for Stereogum, mentioned the album's similarity with Kendrick Lamar's album Mr [11]. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022), noting that Chromakopia is "Tyler's therapy record, his self-conscious attempt to figure his shit out in full view of the public". Billboard's Mackenzie Cummings-Grady wrote that the album "contains something for everyone" and that "within this universal and at times nostalgic construction, the album is also incredibly reflective" [50]. Less enthusiastic reviews complained that the album's sound was too messy and chaotic. NME's Fred Garratt-Stanley regarded the album's sound as "deliberately messy" and the overall message about not trusting people as "lazy" but appreciated the themes and the honest and empathetic lyrics. Slant Magazine's Paul Attard similarly criticized the album's sound and the "overworked" composition, saying that "Tyler's ambitions on Chromakopia are grand, but the album attempts to do a lot while saying little" [45]. 

## Rankings

Chromakopia was featured on several publications' year-end lists of 2024. It was placed second by Clash  and Complex,  and within the top 10 by Billboard,  BrooklynVegan,  Crack,  Dazed,  Exclaim!,  The Guardian,  The Independent,  The Ringer,  and The Skinny [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60]. The album appeared in the top 20 of rankings by The A.V [61]. Club,  Consequence,  KCRW,  The Line of Best Fit,  Paste,  PopMatters,  Rolling Stone,  Stereogum,  and Yardbarker [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69]. Chromakopia was also included in the top 50 of publications' lists like Time Out  and NME,  as well as in unranked compilations and honorable mentions done by Alternative Press,  Cosmopolitan,  HuffPost,  Hypebeast,  NPR,  Uproxx,  and Vulture [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78]. On individual critics' lists, the album was ranked fourth by Variety's Jem Aswad,  and respectively tenth and eighth by Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot, the hosts of Sound Opinions [79] [80]. 

# Commercial performance

Chromakopia earned about 85,665,784 first-day streams on the global Spotify chart, averaging over 6 million streams per song; it is one of the top 20 Spotify debuts of all time. It also simultaneously occupied the entire top 14 on the US Spotify charts, with "St. Chroma" being No. 1 with 5.261 million streams. Chromakopia also reached No [82]. 1 on the US Apple Music Albums chart and simultaneously occupied the entire top 12 on the US Apple Music Songs Chart with "St. Chroma" also being No. 1. Despite being released on Monday, Chromakopia debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart with 299,500 album equivalent units sold in its partial week along with 142,000 pure sales. Chromakopia surpassed Call Me If You Get Lost (169,000 units) as Tyler's biggest first week sales [84]. The album also marked the biggest debut, by units, for a rap album released in 2024 at the time,   before this was surpassed by Kendrick Lamar's GNX the next month [85] [86]. The single "Noid" and the track "St. Chroma" peaked at No. 10 and 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively, marking his first top 10 hits on that chart. In Chromakopia's second week, the album earned 160,000 equivalent album units in the United States, securing a second consecutive week at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. On the Hot 100, "Sticky" jumped to a new peak of number 10, having debuted at number 14 [88]. The album became Tyler's first to spend multiple consecutive weeks at number one and to secure 3 songs in the Billboard Hot 100's top 10. It earned 104,000 units on its third week, securing the top spot on the Billboard 200 [89]. The album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart. The single "Noid" and two other songs for the album charted on the UK Singles Chart: "Noid" (16), "St. Chroma" (15), and "Darling, I" (24). UK chart rules prevent artists from having more than three songs in the top 40 at once; without these rules, Chromakopia would have generated further new entries in the countdown [91] [92]. The album also debuted atop the Australian ARIA Charts, the Dutch Album Top 100, the Irish Albums Chart, the New Zealand RMNZ chart, and the Scottish Albums Chart. [93].
