Cowboy_Carter

Cowboy Carter (also referred to as Act II: Cowboy Carter) is the eighth studio album by American singer and songwriter Beyoncé, released on March 29, 2024, via Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records. A concept album, Cowboy Carter is the second of a planned trilogy of albums, following Renaissance (2022). Beyoncé conceived Cowboy Carter as a journey through a reinvention of Americana, spotlighting the overlooked contributions of Black pioneers to American musical and cultural history.
Mostly labeled a country and Americana album, Cowboy Carter blends together diverse Southern sub-genres that Beyoncé listened to when growing up in Texas, including zydeco, rock and roll, folk, rhythm and blues, pop, psychedelic soul, hip-hop and bluegrass. Conceptually, the album is presented as a radio broadcast, with country singers Dolly Parton, Linda Martell, and Willie Nelson acting as disc jockeys. The album's songs feature rising Black country artists such as Shaboozey, Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, Reyna Roberts, and Willie Jones. The music is driven by a range of acoustic instruments played by musicians including Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Nile Rodgers, Jon Batiste, and Rhiannon Giddens.
Cowboy Carter was met with universal acclaim and appeared on multiple year-end lists; critics felt that the album's genre experimentation, expansive scope, and eclectic references aided an ambitious reimagining of Americana and country through the lens of their Black roots. The album increased the listenership of country music, drove cultural conversations on Black musicians' place within the genre, boosted the careers of rising country artists, and increased the popularity of Western wear and culture. At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, Cowboy Carter earned eleven nominations (including Album of the Year and Best Country Album), making it the third-most nominated album in Grammy history.
Cowboy Carter debuted at number one in several countries and broke certain chart and streaming records. In the United States, Cowboy Carter became Beyoncé's eighth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200 and the first album by a black woman to top the Top Country Albums chart. The album was supported three singles, "Texas Hold 'Em", "16 Carriages" and "II Most Wanted", with the first becoming Beyoncé's ninth U.S. number-one single and the first country song by a Black woman to top the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts.

# Background and development

Beyoncé was born and raised in Houston, where the city's cowboy heritage and country and zydeco music played a role in her upbringing. She listened to country music from an early age, particularly from her paternal grandfather, and her family attended the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo every year in western clothing [23] [4]. She performed at the Rodeo four times between 2001 and 2007, and has continued to celebrate her country and Southern roots throughout her career [5]. [a]. Beyoncé first released an original country song in 2016: the track "Daddy Lessons" on her sixth studio album Lemonade. Beyoncé, together with the Chicks (who had previously covered the song), performed the track at the 50th Annual Country Music Association Awards on November 2, 2016 [12]. The performance was largely praised by critics and gave the Country Music Association Awards their highest viewership in history; however, it was also met with backlash, with some country music fans criticizing Beyoncé's attendance and claiming she did not belong in the genre. The Country Music Association deleted all promotional posts about Beyoncé's performance, which was seen by some observers as succumbing to the pressure from conservative and racist viewers. In December 2016, The Recording Academy's country music committee rejected "Daddy Lessons" for consideration for a Grammy Award, with publications reporting that the song was not seen as being "country enough" [13] [14]. This experience led to the creation of Cowboy Carter. Beyoncé explained how it was made clear to her that she was not welcome in the country music space, which encouraged her to explore the musical history of the genre rather than letting the critics force her out of it. She delved into the history of country music and Western culture and researched its African-American roots. She studied "our rich musical archive" and learned from educators who had long advocated for a re-education on the black roots of country music. She also read that, historically, half of cowboys were black, which made her realize how much of the Black, brown and Native cowboy stories are missing in American history. This was the inspiration for her 2021 "Ivy Park Rodeo" clothing collection [17]. Following this research, Beyoncé conceived Cowboy Carter as a journey through a reinvention of Americana, in which she redefines its boundaries and spotlights overlooked contributions of African-Americans to diverse musical genres, Southern and Western culture, and American history . Collaborator Rhiannon Giddens said Beyoncé did not intend to create a typical crossover country album, but instead wanted to explore her family's roots through music [18]. Cowboy Carter was over five years in the making. Beyoncé began to write the album in 2019, then recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic, which she described as her most creative period. The album forms "Act II" of a trilogy project that Beyoncé recorded during this period [20]. The first act, Renaissance (2022), is primarily a house and disco record highlighting and celebrating the Black progenitors of dance music, leading some to believe that each album of the trilogy would aim to explore the Black roots of a different musical genre [21]. Cowboy Carter was originally intended to be released before Renaissance, but Beyoncé changed the order in response to the pandemic [22]. Between 2020 and 2024, Dolly Parton often said that she would like Beyoncé to cover her song "Jolene". She said that "the song has been recorded worldwide over 400 times in lots of different languages", but she always wanted to hear Beyoncé make the song like a "powerhouse", in the same vein as Whitney Houston's cover of "I Will Always Love You". 

# Composition

Beyoncé recorded around 100 songs for the album. Each song is its own reimagined version of a Western film,  including Five Fingers For Marseilles (2017), Urban Cowboy (1980), The Hateful Eight (2015), Space Cowboys (2000), The Harder They Fall (2021), Killers of the Flower Moon (2023), Thelma & Louise (1991), and O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000) [27] [28]. While Cowboy Carter is predominantly a country, western, country pop, Americana,    pop,  blues, folk, classic rock, hip hop and R&B, the album blends together various styles of music that Beyoncé listened to when growing up in Texas, including zydeco, rock and roll, psychedelic soul, rhythm and blues, funk, gospel, bluegrass, opera, rock, honky-tonk and go-go [29] [30] [31] [32]. The album also fuses in more contemporary and international musical styles, such as hip hop, pop, house, Jersey club, flamenco, funk carioca, fado and Irish folk [33] [34] [35]. Beyoncé's experimentation with musical styles on Cowboy Carter aims to break down the limitations placed on genre-based music, in the service of redefining the boundaries of Americana [36] [37]. The album's genre experimentation received significant discussion in the media, with publications describing the album as "genre-busting", "genre-defying", "genre-bending", and "genre-blending" [18] [38]. Music critics differed in their classification of the album: some simply defined it as "country" or "country-and-Western",   while others opined that the album is not a country album per se but uses country signifiers to explore various genres [39] [40] [201] [42] [43] [44]. Beyoncé herself said about Cowboy Carter: "This ain't a Country album [96] [46] [47]. This is a 'Beyoncé' album.", which USA Today's Kofi Mframa said was a "resounding testament to Beyoncé's long history of refusal to adhere to the traditional confines of genre". The album is presented as a broadcast by a fictional Texas radio station, with country singers Dolly Parton, Linda Martell and Willie Nelson acting as radio DJs. The album features rising country artists Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, Reyna Roberts, Shaboozey and Willie Jones [48]. The album is cyclical, with the final note looping seamlessly into the beginning of the first track (which begins "Nothing really ends") in the same manner as James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (1939), according to The Washington Post's Shane O'Neill [18]. The album features a range of acoustic instruments played by musicians including Stevie Wonder on harmonica, Paul McCartney and Nile Rodgers on guitar, and Rhiannon Giddens on banjo [287]. 

# Promotion and release

## Lead singles

On February 11, 2024, during Super Bowl LVIII, Verizon aired a commercial starring Beyoncé entitled "Can't B Broken", in which she tried to "break the Internet" through increasingly outlandish means, such as releasing a jazz saxophone record, performing on top of Sphere in Las Vegas, building an artificial intelligence (AI) version of herself, launching a collection of Barbie-like dolls dubbed "BarBey", announcing her candidacy for a fictional political position, and flying into space for a performance. After all of the ideas proved unsuccessful, Beyoncé concluded the commercial by remarking: "Okay, they ready. Drop the new music". After the commercial aired, Beyoncé released a teaser video for Act II on Instagram. Directed by British artist and filmmaker Nadia Lee Cohen, the video pays homage to Paris, Texas (1984), references border blasters and features Chuck Berry's 1955 track "Maybellene" [52]. The same day, the singer's official website was updated to announce her eighth studio album, with the placeholder name Act II, scheduled for release on March 29 [53] [54]. Subsequently, the album's two lead singles, "Texas Hold 'Em" and "16 Carriages", were simultaneously made available for digital download and streaming [55]. On March 12, Beyoncé announced the album would be titled Cowboy Carter  via a teaser poster of a western saddle with a sash [56] [57] [58]. With this she listed album merchandise of limited-edition CDs with a bonus track, T-shirts, and vinyl variants in red, white, blue and standard black [59]. 

## Album release

On March 19, 2024, Beyoncé revealed the album cover via Instagram, and said there would be "surprises" and collaborations on the album. On March 20, she revealed a limited edition exclusive cover, wearing a sash that reads "act ii BEYINCÉ", referencing her mother Tina's generational family surname [2]. Taglines and film stills for the album were projected onto various museums in New York City [61] [62]. One of these was an unauthorized projection onto the Solomon R [63]. Guggenheim Museum, who genially responded by posting Franz Marc's 1910 painting Three Horses Drinking with the Texas Hold 'Em-inspired caption "This ain't Texas". Beyoncé also posted co-ordinates to the museum on her Instagram story [64]. On March 27, Beyoncé posted a graphic to Instagram of the album's tracklist inspired by vintage posters from the Chitlin' Circuit era. It revealed collaborations with Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson, as well as a cover of the former's "Jolene", and "The Linda Martell Show". The latter song references Linda Martell, the first Black woman to achieve commercial success in the country genre. The CD release comes in four variants, each with a different rear cover depicting Beyoncé. It was released in Japan on March 29  and on April 12 in Europe [67]. After the album's release, fans reported that their pre-ordered physical vinyl and CD copies were missing numerous tracks, with some asking for refunds [68]. 

## Levi's campaign

The American clothing company Levi Strauss & Co. saw an opportunity to better market their brand to a female audience after their product inspired the Cowboy Carter track "Levii's Jeans". On September 30, 2024, the brand announced a global campaign with Beyoncé titled "Reiimagine" that will stretch into 2025. It is based on women's history with the brand and is split into four chapters, the first being a reimagined commercial of the company's 1985 "Laundrette" television spot. Levi's have described the partnership as "the biggest one  [they've] ever done," and expect Beyoncé's impact to help bring in a boost to $2 billion in sales. 

## NFL Halftime show

On November 17, 2024, it was revealed that Beyoncé will perform a Cowboy Carter medley as a halftime show of the National Football League (NFL) match game between the Houston Texans and the Baltimore Ravens during Christmas Day, with the event being available on Netflix. 

# Cover artwork and title

The Cowboy Carter album cover was shot by Blair Caldwell, a Los Angeles-based photographer who is from Texas. Much like the cover for Renaissance—which saw Beyoncé sitting atop a stationary disco ball horse—the Cowboy Carter artwork sees Beyoncé atop a gray horse at a gallop. She rides the horse while sitting sideways (historically, sidesaddle riding was associated with high-status women), dressed in red, white and blue clothing, wearing a cowboy hat and a sash reading "Cowboy Carter". She holds the horse's reins in one hand and a large American flag in the other. The imagery is reminiscent of rodeo queens,  who often are asked to carry the American flag in a rodeo grand entry [74] [75]. The album cover was a topic of discussion and dissection by critics. Francesca T Royster, professor at DePaul University and author of Black Country Music: Listening for Revolutions, wrote: "The aesthetic choice is bold and seems to be signaling the ways that Beyoncé is putting herself into conversations about nationalism, a theme very much central to discourses about country music, patriotism and authenticity, from the times of its origins."  Critics suggested a variety of inspirations and allusions for the cover, including presidential portraits, Jacques-Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps (1801–1805), Marina Abramović's The Hero (2001),  Kehinde Wiley's Equestrian Portrait of King Philip II (Michael Jackson) (2009), the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo,  and Eadweard Muybridge's The Horse in Motion (1878) [78] [74] [78]. The album is titled after a character "Cowboy Carter", who is inspired by the original Black cowboys of the American West. Beyoncé explained: "The word cowboy itself was used in a derogatory way to describe the former slaves as "boys," who were the most skilled and had the hardest jobs of handling horses and cattle, alike [79]. In destroying the negative connotation, what remains is the strength and resiliency of these men who were the true definition of Western fortitude". 

# Critical reception

Cowboy Carter was met with critical acclaim upon release, with some describing it as a "masterpiece". [b] Critics praised Beyoncé's blending of diverse musical genres and vocal performance, and described the album as both a grand political statement and a personal ode to Beyoncé's roots. On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the album received a weighted average score of 91 from 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim" [94] [96] [97]. Critics lauded Cowboy Carter as an exploration and reinvention of Americana, as well as a celebration of Black southern culture and its contribution to the country music genre. The Atlantic's Spencer Kornhaber and the Evening Standard's Gemma Samways noted that the album experiments with the touchstones and musical traditions of country and Americana in order to explore its Black cultural roots. Maria Sherman of the Associated Press wrote that the "eclectic" and "epic" album "redefines American style" and requires close examination of its references, themes and messages for full enjoyment [98] [31]. HipHopDX's Tai Saint-Louis described the album as a reclamation of both the "deep roots from which Beyoncé has crafted her artistry" and "the many branches that have sprouted from Black music in America" [99]. Variety's chief music critic Chris Willman characterized the album as a "piece of agitprop and socially significant performance art" that both reflects and impacts the history of Black music and country [100]. Critics commended the album for what they described as its ambitious experimentation with music genres, with Beyoncé reimagining country music in her image. [c] Neil McCormick of The Telegraph felt the album pushed the boundaries of genres and mixed diverse musical styles as a polemic against the conservatism of the country genre. Clash and Billboard characterized the album as an ethnomusicological study that venerates the breadth of musical subcultures of the American South,   while The New York Times critic Ben Sisario described the album as a "broad essay" both on popular music and on genre as a concept [82] [201] [107]. The Independent's Helen Brown and The Sydney Morning Herald's Robert Moran opined that Beyoncé's genre experimentation is in the service of celebrating the overlooked pioneers of country music while spotlighting up-and-coming Black musicians . Robert Christgau said that, while the quality of the songwriting diminishes slightly toward the end, Cowboy Carter's confident and "impressive variety" shows Beyoncé to be "our greatest female pop singer", as well as a "pretty darn good songwriter", with a considerable stake in the country sphere [36] [84]. Many critics praised the album's "ambitious" scope and "cinematic" grandiosity, likening it to a Western epic. [d] The Financial Times's Ludovic Hunter-Tilney compared the album to a blockbuster historical epic, with its "impressive, very American aura of importance" and "the sense that history is not only being told but also made". NPR's Sidney Madden equated each of the tracks to a "full-length film full of scenic grandeur, character and conflicts" that can be dissected and discussed [112]. Sisario opined that the album in its entirety works as film, writing that Cowboy Carter is the central character in a narrative about tackling American cultural history [111]. Writing for the roots music journal No Depression, John Amen commented, "While 2022's Renaissance spotlighted  [Beyoncé] as a global MC throwing the party of the decade, Cowboy Carter, framed as Renaissance's Act II, paints her as a torchbearer and synthesist, an auteur equally adept at playing the archivist and the cultural midwife" [115]. Some critics felt that the album would fare better if it were split by musical style [116]. Petridis wrote that while the album may have worked better as a double-disc, "its wild lurches into eclecticism are the point" and demonstrates Beyoncé's "impressive" ability to "bend musical styles to her will" [110].

Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr [159]. declared Cowboy Carter's broad nominations as a "really impressive" feat, explaining that because Grammy voters are limited to voting in particular fields, Beyoncé's nominations across genres shows that "totally different subsets of voters all really resonated with the music". Cowboy Carter did not receive any nominations at the 58th Annual Country Music Association Awards, in a move widely criticized as an egregious but predictable snub. Several publications attributed the snub to conservatism and racism against black artists in the country music industry [161] [162] [163]. Cowboy Carter collaborator Shaboozey, who received his first two CMA Awards nominations, expressed his gratitude for Beyoncé following the snub, writing: "Thank you Beyoncé for opening a door for us, starting a conversation, and giving us one of the most innovative country albums of all time" [164] [170] [166].

The Ralph Lauren Corporation designer brand was inspired by the trend for their 2024 fall/winter collection . GQ's Editor-in-Chief Will Welch credited Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter for inspiring the 'American Rodeo' western theme of the 29th annual Men of the Year party [264]. In the UK, a national survey found that 25% of respondents took up line dancing and 40% started wearing Western clothing following the release of Cowboy Carter. Publications reported that the album aided a reclamation of country identity and western culture by black people [208]. The album had an impact on rodeos in Canada such as the Calgary Stampede, broadening its audience [216] [266]. 

## Business

After Beyoncé referenced the American clothing company Levi Strauss & Co. on the Cowboy Carter track "Levii's Jeans", the company reported a 20% boost on their stock price. The album singlehandedly generated an additional $1.2 million for the brand, from an increase of 1.5 billion impressions online [268]. Levi's also noted a 20% rise in footfall at US stores after the release of the album, while British retailer John Lewis & Partners reported that searches for "women's Levi's jeans" were up 263% since the record was announced [269]. In reference to the track name, Levi's added a second letter "i" to its name and logo on social media [270]. Levi Strauss CFO Harmit Singh described Beyoncé as "the center of culture, the cultural czar", adding: "We are humbled and honored that she chose us to talk about our brand" [271] [272]. Following the release of Cowboy Carter, ridesharing company Uber offered 16% off to riders who use the code "16CARRIAGES", a reference to a song on the album. In response, Lyft offered its riders 50% off with the code "SPAGHETTI24", another reference to a song on the album [273]. Lyft also changed images of cars on its map to white horses as a reference to the Cowboy Carter album cover [274].
