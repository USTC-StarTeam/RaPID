Earlier in his career, Inoue held the World Boxing Council (WBC) light flyweight title in 2014, the World Boxing Organization (WBO) junior bantamweight title from 2014 to 2018, and the World Boxing Association (WBA) bantamweight title (Unified version) from 2018 to 2019. He has also held the lineal championship at bantamweight and super bantamweight, and won the 2018–2019 World Boxing Super Series bantamweight tournament.

On 5 January 2013, Inoue made a light work of Thai national champion Ngaoprajan Chuwatana, by scoring a first-round knockout. Inoue's third pro fight took place on 16 April 2013, against  Yūki Sano. In the first round, Inoue cut his opponent's right eye with a left hook, and in the second round, Inoue knocked Sano down with a left hook after feinting a left body blow. However, in the third round, Inoue injured his right fist when his right straight hit Sano's head. After that, Inoue was unable to land a right punch and was forced to fight with just his left hand, but in the fourth round, Inoue knocked Sano down with a series of left hooks and won by TKO at 1 minute and 9 seconds in the tenth round. On 25 August 2013, Inoue captured the Japanese light flyweight title from Ryoichi Taguchi. With this victory, Inoue became the first Japanese champion in 23 years to win the title in just four fights, tying the record held by Joichiro Tatsuyoshi. Inoue then fought for the vacant OPBF light flyweight title against Filipino light flyweight champion Jerson Mancio on 6 December 2013 on the undercard of Yaegashi-Sosa. Inoue defeated Mancio with a 5th-round TKO to claim the regional title. In his sixth pro fight, Inoue stopped Adrián Hernández by TKO in the sixth round to win the WBC light flyweight championship at Ota-City General Gymnasium on 6 April 2014.

He knocked his opponent down in the fourth and sixth rounds, and won by TKO in the eleventh round at 1 minute and 8 seconds, successfully defending his title for the first time. After the fight, Inoue announced that he would relinquish his title and move up a weight class. 

## Super flyweight

In November 2014, Inoue vacated his light flyweight title and moved up two weight classes to super flyweight to challenge two division champion and current WBO junior bantamweight title holder Omar Andrés Narváez. Inoue won the fight by body shot KO in the 2nd round [28]. On 29 Dec 2015, Inoue faced Warlito Parrenas. The referee waved off the fight in the second round, after Parrenas was dropped twice and he could not get up, giving Inoue a KO win [30]. On 8 May 2016, Inoue faced his WBO  challenger David Carmona. In the second round, he hit Carmona's temple with a right straight and injured his right hand. However, he went on to win the fight by unanimous decision and successfully defend his title for the second time. Inoue's third defense came against Petchbarngborn Kokietgym on 4 September 2016. Kokietgym and Inoue won the fight by KO at 3 minutes and 3 seconds of round 10, successfully defending his title for the third time. On 9 November, it was announced that Inoue's fourth defense would come against Kohei Kono on 30 December 2016. Kono was a two-time super flyweight champion [34]. Inoue won the fight in the sixth round. During 2016, Inoue repeatedly sought a unification bout against four-division champion and current WBC super flyweight champion Román González. However, González chose to face Carlos Cuadras instead in the second half of the year [36] [37] [38]. And Inoue was in attendance for the González vs Cuadras fight [39]. Shortly after González's win over Cuadras, representatives of Inoue sent a formal offer to González for what would've been a unification showdown. González stipulated that the terms offered for an Inoue fight weren't good enough, and turned down the contract. Inoue's fifth defense of his WBO title came against Ricardo Rodríguez in May 2017 and he  won the fight in the 3rd round following a flurry of punches. Inoue joined the HBO Boxing After Dark card "Superfly" set at the StubHub Center on 9 September 2017 against Antonio Nieves and Inoue won the bout. On 16 November, it was announced that Inoue would face Yan Boyeaux on 30 December, in a show televised by Fuji TV.

Inoue knocked out McDonnell in the first round. McDonnell was sent down to the canvas after Inoue landed a left hook to his temple. The referee waved the fight off within less than a round declaring Inoue the TKO victor. Inoue became the only fighter to stop McDonnell and defeat him at bantamweight. 

### World Boxing Super Series

After defeating McDonnell, Inoue said, "I'll participate in the World Boxing Super Series to face other world champions with pleasure," confirming he would take part in the bantamweight tournament, where he would meet other world champions, WBA 'Super champion' Ryan Burnett, WBO champion Zolani Tete (27–3, 21 KOs) and IBF champion Emmanuel Rodríguez. At the draft gala on 20 July, Inoue chose to defend his WBA title against former WBA(Undisputed) bantamweight champion Juan Carlo Payano in the quarter-final. The fight was announced to take place on 7 October at the Yokohama Arena in Yokohama, Japan [53] [54]. Inoue won the fight with a first-round knockout. It was a right hand just 70 seconds into their scheduled 12-round bout. Inoue connected with a jab before blasting Payano with a straight right hand that put Payano flat on his back and unable to continue. Referee Pinit Prayadsab immediately stopped the fight at 1:10 into the first round. Inoue became the first fighter to stop Payano. The knockout was later voted the Ring magazine Knockout of the Year [56] [57]. IBF bantamweight champion Emmanuel Rodríguez defeated Jason Moloney via decision in October 2018, booking his place into the semi-final against Inoue. The fight was set to take place at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, Scotland, on 18 May 2019. On 18 May, Inoue advanced to the final by knocking out undefeated Rodríguez in the second round.

The fight was later voted the Ring magazine Fight of the Year [64]. Inoue faced future WBO bantamweight champion Jason Moloney on 31 October at the MGM Grand Conference Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Inoue landed a short right hand to drop Moloney and score a knockout victory [68]. Referee Kenny Bayless stopped the fight at 2:59 of the 7th round. Inoue became the first fighter to stop Moloney. Inoue faced his IBF mandatory challenger and current IBO bantamweight champion Michael Dasmariñas  on 19 June 2021 in Paradise, Nevada. He scored three knockdowns in the span of three rounds, each one with a left hook to the body of Dasmariñas, to win via third-round stoppage [70] [71]. It was announced on 21 October 2021 that Inoue would be defending his bantamweight world titles in a voluntary defense against IBF No. 6 ranked contender Aran Dipaen on 14 December 2021, at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo. Inoue won the fight by an eight-round technical knockout [73] [74] [75] [76] [77]. Inoue knocked Dipaen down with a left hook in the eighth round, and staggered Dipaen by a second left hook as soon as the action resumed, which prompted referee Michiaki Someya to wave the fight off. Inoue was later named the 2021 "Fighter of the Year" by the Japanese Boxing Commission [78] [79]. Inoue made his fifth title defense as a unified bantamweight champion in a title unification bout with the reigning WBC champion Nonito Donaire on 7 June 2022, at the Saitama Super Arena in Saitama, Japan. Inoue won the rematch by a second-round technical knockout [81] [82]. After knocking Donaire down at the very end of the first round, Inoue once again staggered him with a left hook near the start of the second round, before finishing him with a flurry of punches at the 1:24-minute mark of the round. He became the only fighter to stop Donaire at bantamweight. Inoue was ranked as the number one pound for pound boxer by The Ring and TBRB after this victory, thus becoming the first Japanese boxer to reach that milestone [83]. 

### Undisputed Bantamweight champion

On 25 August 2022, it was announced that Inoue would face 2 time bantamweight champion and the current reigning WBO bantamweight champion Paul Butler in a title unification bout on 13 December 2022, at the Ariake Arena in Tokyo, Japan. Inoue won the fight by an eleventh-round knockout, as he stopped Butler with repeated body shots at the 1:09-minute mark of the round [87] [88]. He was up 100–90 on all three scorecards at the time of the stoppage. With this win, Inoue became the first undisputed bantamweight champion since Enrique Pinder in 1972 and the first undisputed bantamweight champion in four-belt era. He also became the first-ever Japanese and Asian boxer to claim undisputed championship status in the three- or four-belt era,  as well as the first and only boxer in history to defeat all four major sanctioning organisation champions by knockout [92]. And with this win, he also set the new record for the most wins in unified title bouts in bantamweight history, at 7, surpassing the great bantamweight legend Rubén Olivares. Inoue vacated all five titles on 13 January 2023, as he moved up to super bantamweight [93]. 

## Super bantamweight

On 18 January 2023, it was revealed that Inoue had entered into negotiations with the undefeated unified super bantamweight world champion Stephen Fulton. The fight was expected to take place at the Yokohama Arena in Yokohama, Japan, on 7 May 2023 [95]. The fight was postponed on 21 March, as Inoue suffered a fist injury during training camp [96]. The bout was rescheduled for 25 July 2023, at the Ariake Arena in Tokyo, Japan [97]. Inoue won the fight by an eighth-round technical knockout.

### Undisputed Super bantamweight champion

On 21 August 2023, it was reported that Inoue had entered into negotiations with two division champion and current unified WBA (Super) and IBF super bantamweight champion Marlon Tapales for an undisputed title bout. The fight was also for lineal championship and took place at Ariake Arena in Tokyo, Japan on 26 December 2023 [104]. Inoue won the fight by tenth-round knockout to become the first ever undisputed super bantamweight champion and a two-division undisputed champion, just a year after fully unifying the bantamweight division. Tapales was knocked down in the fourth round and again in the tenth, with the second knockdown rendering him unable to rise from the canvas in time to beat the count. This was Inoue's 19th recorded KO in 21 world title fights, bringing his KO rate to 90.4%, which is the highest KO rate in the history of world title matches [107]. On 8 January 2024, it was reported that Inoue would make his first title defense as an undisputed champion against the WBC mandatory title challenger and former two division champion, Luis Nery. The bout was scheduled for 6 May 2024 at Tokyo Dome and was the first boxing match taking place at the venue since 1990 [109] [110]. Despite suffering the first knockdown of his professional career in the opening round, Inoue won the fight by a sixth round knockout. He dropped Nery once in the second round and again in the fifth round, before a third and final knockdown in the sixth round ended the fight. Due to the significance of this bout, Inoue was awarded the honorary WBC Diamond belt [113] [114] [115]. After this victory, Inoue was ranked as the number one pound for pound boxer for the second time in his career by The Ring and TBRB [116].

Inoue made the second defense of his undisputed super bantamweight title against former IBF super bantamweight champion TJ Doheny at Ariake Arena in Tokyo on 3 September 2024.
