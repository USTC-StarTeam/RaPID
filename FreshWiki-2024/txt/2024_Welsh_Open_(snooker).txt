## Later rounds

### Quarter-finals

Allen tied the scores at the mid-session interval but Higgins won three consecutive frames for a 5‍–‍2 victory, reaching his fourth ranking semi-final of the season. Higgins commented: "Mark  [Allen] is one of the elite players, you have to play well to beat him, it's a brilliant win for me." He also attributed the win to his new cue, saying: "I went back to the size I used about 25 years ago. That seems to be working right now. Hopefully things can come together because I have been knocking on the door for a while and it hasn't opened yet."  Slessor compiled a 128 break as he took a 3‍–‍1 break over Dale [26]. Dale won two of the next three frames to reduce Slessor's lead to one at 4‍–‍3, but Slessor won the eighth frame to win 5‍–‍3 and reach the third ranking semi-final of his career. Slessor said: "I'm delighted to win. I have been working with  [coach] Chris Henry this season and my game has turned a corner." [26] [27]. Gary Wilson won all four frames before the mid-session interval to lead McGill 4‍–‍0, and won the fifth on the last black to complete a whitewash victory. He said after the match: "I have tried to stick to what I'm doing, because it was working at the Scottish. That has helped me to just go out and play without any rubbish in my head, and to be a bit more consistent. In the past I would not be able to play certain shots, but I don't feel that way any more."  The second seed Brecel led world number 76 O'Donnell 2‍–‍1 and 3‍–‍2, but O'Donnell took the next two frames, making a 130 break in the sixth, to lead 4‍–‍3 [28]. O'Donnell won frame eight on the last black to defeat the reigning World Champion 5‍–‍3. It was his second win over Brecel that season, after a 4‍–‍2 victory in the last 32 of the 2023 Scottish Open. O'Donnell reached his second career ranking semi-final, after the 2018 Shoot Out. He commented: "I do try hard out there, sometimes too hard [29] [30]. I still try to play as if it means everything, but I am able to handle defeats better and move on. I have played a bit quicker too and that seems to be helping." [28]. 

### Semi-finals

The semi-finals were played on 17 February as the best of 11 frames. In the first semi-final, O'Donnell played Slessor [3]. O'Donnell led 5‍–‍3, but Slessor made breaks of 95 and 65 to force a deciding frame. O'Donnell won the decider with a 126 break, his first victory in a ranking semi-final. He commented: "It means everything to reach my first final [31] [32]. There have been some dark times in the last few years. My fiancée Anna and kids have picked me up and got me through those dark days."  Calling his performance "useless" and describing his safety play as "embarrassing", Slessor said: "I have played some good stuff this week but it's very disappointing to play like that in the semis." [33] [33]. Facing five-time champion Higgins in the second semi-final, Gary Wilson attempted a maximum break in the first frame, but missed the 14th red to end the break at 104. Wilson successfully completed a maximum in the second frame, the fifth of his career and the 11th time a maximum had been made at the Welsh Open. Wilson led 4‍–‍0 and 5‍–‍1 before Higgins won three frames in a row with breaks of 69, 66, and 78 to come within one frame at 5‍–‍4 [34]. Wilson took the 10th frame with a 73 break to win 6‍–‍4. Wilson said: "I didn't do a lot wrong and played very well in patches." He added: "The 147 was early in the match, I wasn't even thinking about it at the start, I was just looking to build a lead [35] [36]. I should have had one in the frame before, I had a chance at it."  Higgins commented: "He was deadly for the first three-and-a-half frames, incredible [31]. Gary  [Wilson] played superbly, I give him credit, there was nothing I could do." [31].
