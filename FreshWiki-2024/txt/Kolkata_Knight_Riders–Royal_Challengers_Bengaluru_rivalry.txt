Kolkata_Knight_Riders–Royal_Challengers_Bengaluru_rivalry

The Kolkata Knight Riders-Royal Challengers Bangalore rivalry is a cricket rivalry between the IPL teams of Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the defunct Champions League Twenty20 (CLT20). It is the oldest rivalry of the IPL and is often referred to as the El Primero of the Indian Premier League. Both teams have faced each other 34 times in the IPL and  1 time in CLT20, with the Kolkata Knight Riders having more victories (21). Kolkata Knight Riders have 3 IPL titles, while Royal Challengers Bangalore have none.
The rivalry became more intense when, during the 2013 Indian Premier League faceoff between the two teams, Gautam Gambhir had a verbal spat with Virat Kohli when Kohli was sledged after being dismissed by Lakshmipathy Balaji. This incident increased the hype of the rivalry and is still constant despite the departure of Gambhir from the Knight Riders in 2018.
The highest run-scorer from this fixture is Virat Kohli (Royal Challengers Bangalore) with 962 runs, while the highest wicket-taker is Sunil Narine (Kolkata Knight Riders) with 26 wickets.

## 2008

### Round 1: The beginning of Indian Premier League

Both the teams played the inaugural match of the Indian Premier League. RCB won the first toss of the tournament and elected to bowl. KKR batting first, posted a mammoth total of 222 runs for 3 wickets in 20 overs due to a marvellous inning played by Brendon McCullum who scored 158* in 73 balls and became the first centurion of the tournament. The second inning saw the RCB batters struggling against KKR pacers and were bowled out for just 82 runs. Ajit Agarkar picked-up the first three-wicket haul (3/25) of the tournament. The winning margin of 140 runs by Knight Riders was the biggest winning margin in terms of runs until Royal Challengers had beaten it against Gujarat Lions in 2016. 

## 2009: 100th match of Indian Premier League

The 100th match of the Indian Premier League saw both teams playing against each other at the SuperSport Park, Centurion as the tournament was shifted to South Africa due to the 2009 Indian general election. RCB won the first toss of the tournament and elected to bowl. Brendon McCullum continued his form against the Royal Challengers scoring 84 runs. KKR lost their first two wickets in quick succession for just 21 runs, but the partnership between McCullum and David Hussey helped stabilise the conditions which helped the team reach a total of 173 runs.. Batting second, the Royal Challengers started steadily with a 58-run opening stand between Jesse Ryder and Jacques Kallis. The team lost two wickets in quick succession which reduced them to 74/3, but the partnership between Ross Taylor and Rahul Dravid and later Taylor and Mark Boucher took the team to the finish line successfully. Taylor played a mindblowing innings of 81 runs in just 33 balls and was adjudged the Player of the Match. 

## 2013: A new chapter

During the second innings of the match between both the teams in the 2013 Indian Premier League at Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore, Virat Kohli was dismissed and sledged by Lakshmipathy Balaji, which led to a heating exchange between them. Gautam Gambhir also stepped in the matter in defence of his KKR teammate which led to a verbal spat between him and Kohli. However, the Royal Challengers comfortably won the match due to Chris Gayle's 81*. This incident opened a new chapter in the rivalry which gave more hype to the rivalry of both teams. Since then, the rivalry has often been called the "Kohli-Gambhir Rivalry". During an interview with Jatin Sapru, Gambhir praised Kohli for the impressive transformation he has shown in his personality as an athlete and as a person."That's why there was nothing personal  [then] and there never will be personal against Virat Kohli. And I say again and again that what he's achieved, I am not surprised. That's the kind of player he was when we saw him early but what he's transformed into, I think from a fitness point of view and the way he's worked on his skills is tremendous." [11]. 

## 2017

### Round 1: The debacle at Eden Gardens

It was the tenth edition of the Indian Premier League. Both teams played against each other on 23 April 2017 at Eden Gardens, Kolkata where the Royal Challengers won the toss and elected to bowl.

Sunil Narine hit an important 34 runs in 17 balls in the first innings. Although it initially seemed like the Royal Challengers were set for an easy win, the KKR pacers dismissed the top order within the first three overs, resulting in a significant setback for the team as their backbone had gone to the pavilion. This eventually led to the team's downfall, as they were bowled out for just 49 runs, the tournament's lowest score to date. This was the first match in the tournament where all the 10 wickets were taken by pacers, with Umesh Yadav taking 1 wicket and Chris Woakes, Colin de Grandhomme and Nathan Coulter-Nile clinching 3 wickets each.

Akash Deep picked up three wickets (3-20) and Mohammed Siraj picked up a single wicket (1-25).. While it seemed to be an easy chase for the Challengers, the Knights pacers Umesh (2-16) and Southee (3-20) made it quite difficult as they dismissed the top-order batters back to the pavilion for just 17 runs. While it was a slow start for the Royal Challengers, David Willey (18) and Sherfane Rutherford (28) and later, Rutherford and Shahbaz Ahmed (27) brought the team back on track with a slow but steady 45 and 39 runs partnership respectively.

Ramandeep Singh hit some quick shots towards the end and the partnership between him and Russell led the Knight Riders to a total of 222 runs with the loss of 6 wickets. Cameron Green picked up 2 crucial wickets conceding only 35 runs, which helped Royal Challengers restrict the batting side from scoring more runs. Yash Dayal clinched 2 wickets while Mohammed Siraj and Lockie Ferguson took 1 wicket each.Despite not taking any wickets, Karn Sharma conceded only 33 runs in his full quota of 4 overs, which could have been advantageous for the team, considering the pitch conditions.. In the second innings, the Kohli-du Plessis pair put pressure on the bowlers right from the beginning. During the 3rd over, Harshit Rana caught and bowled Kohli by bowling a slower full-toss to Kohli, which was too given out by the on-field umpires. However, Kohli was reluctant with this decision and decided to review this appeal, but the third umpire too supported the decision of the on-field umpires. This led to an exchange of heat between Kohli and on-field umpires. Faf was also dismissed in the next over. Will Jacks and Rajat Patidar formed a partnership, scoring a century to keep the team on track for the chase, which was ultimately broken by Russell who picked up both of their wickets in the same over. In the next over, despite conceding runs, Narine picked 2 wickets in the same over, bringing the game under their control. Dinesh Karthik and Suyash Prabhudessai were chasing towards the target steadily, but Harshit got Prabhudessai out. Russell took the wicket of Karthik, with Bangalore now needing 21 runs in the last over. While it seemed it would be a win for Kolkata, it was no less than a roller coaster adventure. The last over was bowled by Mitchell Starc, who conceded 3 sixes in the first 4 balls by Karn Sharma, with the Royal Challengers needing 3 off just 2 balls now. Karn was caught and bowled by Starc in the fifth ball, with 3 runs needed off the last ball. In the last ball, Ferguson digs it well at deep cover and sets off for a second run. But the throw by Ramandeep towards the keeper ensured the victory for the Knight Riders by the slightest margin of just 1 run. The bowlers conceded just 28 in the last 4 overs before the last over which had made the difference. Narine and Harshit clinched two wickets each with Varun Chakravarthy and Starc picking a wicket each. Andre Russell took 3 wickets for just 25 runs in 3 overs and was awarded the Player of the Match.. The dismissal of Kohli sparked a social media feud, with the users divided into two factions. Cricketers such as Navjot Singh Sidhu and Mohammed Kaif came in support of Kohli and criticized the immature decision by the umpires, experts such as Harsha Bhogle and Irfan Pathan came in support of the decision. The next day, Star Sports clarified the confusion by stating, "Virat was indeed out as per the official rule book. The rule states that for a delivery to be considered a no-ball, the ball must be at waist height as it crosses the stepping crease. In Kohli's situation, while the ball was at waist height when he encountered it, as it crossed the stepping crease, it was below waist height, making it a fair delivery based on the official rule." Moreover, Kohli has been fined 50 percent of his match fees for breaching the Level 1 IPL Code of Conduct. This match is considered the closest and most thrilling contest in their head-to-head history [14].
