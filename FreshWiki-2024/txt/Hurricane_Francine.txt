Hurricane_Francine

Hurricane Francine was a moderately strong tropical cyclone that brought extensive flooding to parts of the Gulf Coast of the United States, especially Louisiana in September 2024. The sixth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, its formation brought the end to a significant quiet period in tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic. Originating from a tropical wave that was initially spotted in the central Atlantic by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in late August, the disturbance that eventually became Francine began gradually organizing on September 7 as it exited the Yucatán Peninsula into the Bay of Campeche. The disturbance consolidated further and was designated by the NHC as Potential Tropical Cyclone Six on September 8. The next day, it was upgraded to tropical storm status and was named Francine by the NHC. It made landfall in Louisiana on September 11, 2024 as a Category 2 hurricane with wind speeds of 100 mph (161 km/h), which left moderate damage in Louisiana and Mississippi. Afterward, it quickly weakened into a tropical storm on September 12, then a tropical depression the following day. Francine dissipated on September 14.

# Meteorological history

On August 26, the NHC noted that a low-pressure area could form in the Central Tropical Atlantic. Two days later, they began tracking a tropical wave producing disorganized showers [2]. Initially, showers from the wave were a bit more concentrated along its axis,  becoming more organized by August 31 [3] [4]. However, an unfavorable environment for development caused the wave to become disorganized [5]. Several days later, on September 7, the wave crossed into the Bay of Campeche,  becoming a low-pressure area the next day [6] [7]. As a result, a few hours later, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Six at 21:00 UTC on September 8 [8]. Higher wind gusts in the system were enhanced by a barrier jet near the Sierra Madre Oriental [9]. Early the next day, the disturbance intensified into Tropical Storm Francine [9]. The novel storm slowly moved northwest over the next day close to the Mexico–United States border before beginning to move more to the northeast due to a ridge of high pressure over the state of Florida [10]. Steady intensification ensued, with Francine becoming a hurricane at 03:00 UTC on September 11 [11]. Beginning to accelerate northeast towards the Gulf Coast of the United States, an eyewall began developing, even as wind shear began to increase and environmental conditions worsened. Despite this, a ragged eye developed on satellite imagery later that morning, leading to a peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane [13]. At its peak, the storm recorded maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 972 mb (28.7 inHg) at 21:00 UTC. Shortly thereafter, at 22:00 UTC, Francine made landfall in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, still maintaining Category 2 strength [14]. Rapid weakening began after the hurricane made landfall, and at 03:00 UTC on September 12, Francine weakened into a tropical storm [15] [16]. The system further weakened overland, becoming a tropical depression then a post-tropical cyclone [17]. 

# Preparations

## Mexico

Several areas in Matamoros flooded from 200 millimetres (7.9 in) of rain;  aid from the Mexican Government was requested as a result [43]. Water pumps were set up across the city in response [44]. Plans DN-III and Tamaulipas were initiated to provide aid to areas affected by Francine [45]. Exports out to the Gulf of Mexico were disrupted as a result of Francine,  and the storm knocked out 39% of oil and natural gas production [38]. Reductions in production caused crude oil national prices to jump by 2% on September 11 [50]. 

## United States

ExxonMobil and Shell canceled operations in the Gulf of Mexico and evacuated their employees. Amtrak modified and/or suspended service to New Orleans from September 11–18 [1]. 

### Texas

By September 9, Port O'Connor was experiencing flooding conditions. Rainfall in the state peaked at 7.44 in (189 mm) in Brownsville. 

### Louisiana

Francine made landfall in Southern Louisiana, Terrebonne Parish, with sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) at 22:00 UTC on September 11. Storm surge was greater than 4 feet (1.2 m) [53]. A tornado warning was issued for Plaquemines Parish [54]. Around 450,000 people suffered from power outages, most of which were caused by fallen debris, and around 500 people took refuge in emergency shelters [32]. Francine's winds downed numerous trees and power lines, which resulted in blocked roads [55]. Numerous streets sustained flooding as a result of heavy rainfall. The flash flooding resulted in several flash flood emergency alerts being issued [56]. Several rivers crested in Saint Tammany Parish [57]. The Lafourche Parish Sheriff’s Office conducted numerous water rescues northwest of Thibodaux after rising flood waters surrounded multiple housing units, and all residents, including many small children, were safely evacuated [58]. Other water rescues were also carried out in other parts of the Thibodaux area as well as the Kraemer area. A 39-year-old man rescued another man, who had water up to his head, from a sinking truck below an overpass in New Orleans by smashing the truck's back window with a hammer and pulling him out through it and cutting his hand in the process [59]. Two other people were injured: a Louisiana State Police officer who was struck by a falling tree while removing downed trees on Interstate 10, and a woman in Ascension Parish who was also hit and pinned by a fallen tree [60]. The federal government approved a FEMA declaration. According to property data company CoreLogic, insured losses caused by Francine could reach $1.5 billion [63]. Moody’s Analytics estimates over $2 billion dollars in damage, and AccuWeather estimates over $9 billion in damage [64]. As of January 2025, damage is estimated to be at US$1.3 billion. 

### Elsewhere

There were 39,000 reported power outages in Alabama. Trees and power lines were also downed in the western portion of the state [69]. In Danville, rainfall accumulated to 11.11 in (282 mm) [72]. The highest rainfall total was Apalachicola, Florida at 12.75 in (324 mm). Tennessee was buffeted by rainstorms for a few days.

South Mississippi faced significant flooding and related issues during the storm's passage. Other areas of the state also experienced downed trees and power lines [66]. During the morning of September 12, 60,000 customers experienced power outages in Mississippi [72]. Around 500 people were in state shelters [68]. One injury was reported in Jones County [69].
