# Production

## Development

On 2 February 2024, Vijay announced through his social media accounts that he would step into politics after completing his ongoing projects, The Greatest of All Time (2024) and another film tentatively titled Thalapathy 69. The Times of India suggested Karthik Subbaraj would direct the project, with Sun Pictures producing,  while Pinkvilla noted that the director had not been finalised, naming H [5] [6]. Vinoth, Subbaraj or Atlee as potential choices. Later, Vetrimaaran emerged as a possibility,  with the project reportedly being funded by D [7] [8]. V. V. Danayya's DVV Entertainment. However, in March, Vetrimaaran confirmed that he was not involved,  narrowing the options to Trivikram and Vinoth [9] [10] [11]. Reports soon suggested Vinoth was likely to direct [12]. Director RJ Balaji revealed that Vijay had considered scripts from 15–20 directors, including himself, for the project [13]. While working on Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru and Mersal (both 2017) respectively, Vinoth had narrated a script to Vijay, who declined. Vinoth later approached Kamal Haasan, who was impressed and signed him for his 233rd film [16] [17] [18]. However, the project was shelved due to the delays in Indian 2 (2024) and Indian 3 (2025) [19] [20]. Vinoth revisited Vijay with the script,  who reportedly accepted a ₹275 crore (US$32 million) deal, making him the highest-paid Indian actor, surpassing Shah Rukh Khan and Rajinikanth [21] [22] [23]. In August, Vinoth confirmed his role as director, receiving ₹15–20 crore,   with Venkat K [24] [25] [26]. Narayana's KVN Productions funding the project in their first Tamil venture. Vijay's manager, Jagadish Palanisamy, and Lohith N [27]. K. serve as co-producers. The film was made on a ₹300 crore (US$35 million) budget [28]. The project was set to be  announced on 22 June, Vijay's birthday, with shooting commencing from the following month,  but was postponed with the actor's request [1] [29]. The company made a public announcement on 14 September, confirming the project [30]. 

## Pre-production

When Vinoth was committed to Haasan's 233rd film, he received changes from the actor which went to the final script and was narrated to Vijay. Although Vijay was highly impressed with the script,  he had reportedly advised the director to make some changes [32] [33]. Vinoth said the film would be made completely in Vijay's style, unlike his previous films, which he considered to be political [34] [35]. However, the poster announcement of the film, which featured the tagline "torch bearer of democracy",  made some media question the film's genre [36] [37] [38]. A muhurat puja was held on 4 October 2024, the second day of Navaratri, at Prime Studio in Chennai with the film's cast and crew [39]. In early October 2024, Sathyan Sooryan was announced as the cinematographer, marking his second film with Vinoth after Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru (2017) and Vijay after Master (2021). Anirudh Ravichander would score the music, in his first collaboration with the director [42]. Vinoth had further chosen technicians in his maiden collaboration, including editor Pradeep E [43]. Ragav,  stunt choreographer Anl Arasu, art director V [44]. Selvakumar, costume designer Pallavi Singh and choreographer Shekar Master,  while retaining publicity designer Gopi Prasannaa [45]. Ramkumar Balasubramaniam was appointed as executive producer of the film by the production house [46] [47]. 

## Casting

Vijay had reportedly finalised his look for his character at a look test, which was reportedly in early–August at a studio in Chennai. Pooja Hegde was confirmed as the female lead,  in her second collaboration with Vijay after Beast (2022) also marking her fourth Tamil film after Mugamoodi (2012), Beast and Retro (2025) [51] [52] [53]. She would be reportedly receiving a ₹6 crore (US$690,000) remuneration [54]. Hegde's statement after the formal launch, "Halamithi and Habibo Reunites", a reference to the first single from Beast, "Arabic Kuthu", went viral on social media [55] [56]. Hindi actor Bobby Deol was confirmed to play the main antagonist,  in his second Tamil film following Kanguva (2024) [57] [58]. He would be reportedly receiving ₹5 crore (US$580,000) for his remuneration [59] [60]. Gautham Vasudev Menon,  Narain,  Priyamani,  Prakash Raj,  and Varalaxmi Sarathkumar would play prominent roles [62] [63] [64] [65]. Menon would make his second collaboration with Vijay after Leo (2023),  while Raj would also collaborate with the actor for the  seventh time, after namely working together in Ghilli (2004) and Varisu (2023) [66] [67]. Malayalam actress Mamitha Baiju would make her Tamil sophomore after Rebel (2024) [68]. All of their inclusions were confirmed by the production house in early-October 2024 [69]. Monisha Blessy was featured in the muhurat puja, thereby confirming her inclusion [70]. Although Sathyaraj was approached for a role, he declined the role due to scheduling conflicts [71]. Shiva Rajkumar, during the promotions of Bhairathi Ranagal (2024), stated that he was approached by Vinoth for an important role; however, the director later withdrew the offer due to reasons unknown [72]. On 8 January 2025, Teejay Arunasalam in an interview with The Times of India confirmed his inclusion in a role being paired opposite to Mamitha [73] [74]. 

## Filming

Principal photography began with the first schedule on 5 October 2024 at Prasad Studios in Chennai. Filming started with a song sequence, picturised on Vijay and Pooja featuring 500 background artists under the choreography by Sekhar,  at a massively erected set which was built prior to the filming's commencement, in September, under the supervision by V [76] [77]. Selvakumar. The song sequence completed filming on 10 October [78] [79]. After that, Vinoth reportedly completed some portions in 8 days, which were supposed to take 10 days [80]. Initially, the second schedule was planned to take place in Hyderabad, but the production remained in Chennai at the request of Vijay [81]. The team erected a huge set in Payanoor near Chennai for the second schedule [82]. After Vijay completed his political commitments, the schedule commenced on 4 November [83]. Vijay and Hegde joined the schedule in Chennai [84]. During this schedule, Vijay and Vinoth met with the jawans and their families at the Officers Training Academy in Chennai. In mid November, shooting happened at AVIT, Vinayaka Mission Law College, Chennai [86] [87]. Later the production moved to Thiruporur, where a set was erected for action sequences [88] [89]. After a reported seven days of rehearsals in late November, production resumed at a constructed set in Chennai with an action sequence between Vijay and Deol, which lasted for three weeks [90]. Hegde simultaneously filmed her portions in this schedule while filming her portions for Hai Jawani Toh Ishq Hona Hai, which were completed by 3 December [91]. Vijay and Hegde resumed the shooting in mid December which reportedly went for a week [92]. The second schedule was completed on 21 December at a beach in Chennai [93] [94]. Reportedly, 40% of the film's shooting had been completed by schedule [95] [96]. The third schedule will begin from second week of January 2025 after a short break.
