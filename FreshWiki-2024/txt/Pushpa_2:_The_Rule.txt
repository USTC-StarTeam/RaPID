The media lauds Shekhawat for the raid, but Srinu realizes the load was not sandalwood but Sandra, a wood that resembles red sandalwood but holds no market value.

# Reception

## Critical response

Nishad Thaivalappil of News18 gave 5/5 stars and wrote "Pushpa 2: The Rule is a raw, wild, and action-packed extravaganza. With its gripping narrative, larger-than-life performances, and massy appeal, it’s the entertainer of the year. Don’t miss the chance to witness Allu Arjun’s brilliance on the big screen!"  Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5/5 stars and wrote "A wildfire entertainer with mass appeal, blending intense action, gripping drama, emotional depth and Allu Arjun's unmatched swag which elevates the film, making it a must-watch for fans and audiences alike" [148]. Simran Singh of DNA India gave 4.5/5 stars and wrote "Pushpa The Rule: Part Two will RULE the box office [149]. The sky is the limit for this film. Allu Arjun and the team have set new standards in massy entertainers, and very high expectations for the third part. Yes, the saga of Pushpa will continue. Don't miss Pushpa The Rule: Part Two at any chance." [150]. Ganesh Aaglave of Firstpost gave 4/5 stars and wrote "On the whole, Pushpa 2 is bigger, grander and better as Allu Arjun is set to rule the box office with its swag."  Neeshita Nyayapati of Hindustan Times wrote "At the end of it all, Pushpa 2: The Rule is entertaining, makes you chuckle and also feel something for its titular character, even if not flawless and has a shallow message about women's safety [151]. And when you don't notice a runtime as long as this one, that’s a win". Paul Nicodemus of The Times of India gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote "Pushpa 2: The Rule is a sequel that surpasses its predecessor in scale, storytelling, and emotional depth [152]. Sukumar’s vision, combined with Allu Arjun’s powerhouse performance, layered narrative, breathtaking visuals, and stellar ensemble cast, makes it a cinematic triumph that demands to be experienced on the big screen." [153]. Rishil Jogani of Pinkvilla gave 3/5 stars and wrote "Pushpa 2: The Rule is a quintessential mass entertainer that will surely satisfy fans of the franchise. It delivers on the action, drama, and charisma that made the first part so much loved. Yes, the film struggles with pacing, convenience in its screenplay, and the lack of strong antagonists to keep the narrative thrilling."  Anandu Suresh of The Indian Express gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote "The simplest and shortest review of Pushpa 2 would be: “Sarvam Pushpa Mayam [154]. (transl. Everything is about "Pushpa")”"  Janani K of India Today rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote "Compared to the first part, Pushpa 2 feels somewhat disjointed [155]. The sequel focuses more on creating moments rather than building a coherent story". Pranati A S of Deccan Herald rated 2.5/5 and wrote, " Fahadh steals the show with his restlessness and humour [156]. Devi Sri Prasad’s music is nothing exceptional. Mirosław Kuba Brożek’s cinematography is brilliant, these are some takeaways from the otherwise excessively overblaring film." [157]. Sajin Shrijith of The Week gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote "A massive insult to intelligence and peelings". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and stated "Pushpa Part 2 goes hell for leather but large parts of the film are crushed under the weight of its own vaulting ambition" [158]. Arjun Menon of Rediff rated the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote "Pushpa 2 is a badly misjudged, doubtful sequel that can't capitalise on the wealth of the story world set up in the first film" [159]. Sanyukta Thakare of Mashable India gave the film 1.5 out of 5 stars and wrote "Pushpa 2: The Rule does not add anything new to the barrage of similar south characters, nor the action showcased by the entertainment industry" [160]. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu wrote "A stunning ‘jatara’ sequence anchored by a superb Allu Arjun and a few face-offs, director Sukumar's ‘Pushpa 2: The Rule’ seems incoherent and incomplete."  Lekha Menon of Khaleej Times wrote "The music is loud, the editing at several places is disjointed and the action choreography basically includes characters flying in air and Pushpa beating the bad guys to pulp [162]. All of this takes place over a mammoth 205 minutes and while it’s entertaining and pacy, the overall experience makes for a tedious watch. Swathi P Ajith of Onmanorama wrote, "More than just the story, 'Pushpa 2' promises to be an unforgettable experience, especially for Allu Arjun's fans [163]. It’s clear that he has poured his heart and soul into this role, making every moment on screen tantalising." [164].

# Controversies

On 24 November 2024, at the pre-release event in Chennai, composer Devi Sri Prasad blamed the producers for repeated complaints against him that he failed to deliver the background score and songs on time. He said that the producers have more complaints than love for him. Later at the event, producer Ravi Shankar denied the rift and mentioned that there are no issues, and that they are like a family [189]. There were also reports that Thaman S, B [190]. Ajaneesh Loknath and Sam C. S. were hired to compose the background score due to delays in delivering the score on time by Prasad. This controversy also came into light when Mythri Movie Makers, who are also the producers of the upcoming Good Bad Ugly (2025), replaced Prasad with G [191] [192]. V. Prakash Kumar. However, during the Hyderabad event Prasad ended the ongoing controversy with producers and thanked them wholeheartedly and highlighted the special bond between them [193]. Later, Sam C [194]. S. confirmed his involvement in the film's background score. On 30 November 2024, an FIR was filed against Allu Arjun by Srinivas Goud for his comments during the Mumbai press event, where he (Allu Arjun) referred to his fans as an "army." Goud found this comparison disrespectful, arguing that using the term "army" in this context belittles the sacrifices made by the armed forces. In December 2024, a petition demanding a ban on the film was filed in the Telangana High Court, as the film shows corruption, violence and illegal smuggling, however the plea was dismissed. On 4 December 2024, a woman died while her young son was critically injured in a stampede during the film's premiere at Sandhya movie theater near RTC X Roads, Hyderabad.
