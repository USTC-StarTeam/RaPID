143_(Katy_Perry_album)

143 is the seventh studio album by American singer Katy Perry. It was released on September 20, 2024, by Capitol Records. The album title represents the phrase "I love you", and is also Perry's symbolic "angel number". Aiming to create a "dance party" album, she worked with previous collaborators Max Martin, Dr. Luke, and Stargate, while also approaching first-time collaborators Vaughn Oliver and Rocco Did It Again!. 143 features guest appearances from German singer Kim Petras and American rappers 21 Savage, Doechii and JID. Dr. Luke's involvement in the album was widely criticized because of sexual assault allegations from Kesha.
Three singles preceded the album's release: "Woman's World" was released as the lead single on July 11, 2024. The song peaked at number 63 on the US Billboard Hot 100, number 47 on the UK Singles Chart, and reached number 65 on the Billboard Global 200, Perry's second-highest charting entry on the latter. It was followed by the single "Lifetimes" on August 8, and "I'm His, He's Mine" featuring Doechii on September 13. Commercially, the album debuted at number six on both the US Billboard 200 chart and the UK Albums Chart, while reaching the top ten in eight other countries. 143 received negative reviews from music critics, becoming the worst-reviewed album of Perry's career. Most criticized the album as a product of subpar songwriting and outdated, insipid production; several compared 143 to AI-generated music.
A deluxe edition, titled 1432, with four additional tracks was released on December 20, 2024, with "OK" as the albumâ€™s fourth single. In support of the album, Perry is set to embark on the Lifetimes Tour in 2025.

# Background and conception

In August 2020, Katy Perry released her sixth studio album, Smile. It received mixed reviews from critics  and was dubbed by journalists as a commercial disappointment . In August 2023, Perry confirmed in a Good Morning America interview that she was working on new material from a "place of love" [4]. The next February, she made an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and announced her exit from the American Idol judges' panel following the conclusion of the twenty-second season, wanting to "go out and feel that pulse to my own beat" and release new music after being "in the studio for a while" [5]. Two months later, Perry told Access Hollywood that she was working on a "very bright and joyful" album [6]. Rolling Stone reported in June 2024 that Perry had "reconnected" with producers who worked with her before, including Max Martin, Stargate, and Dr. Luke. During a livestream via her social media on July 10, 2024, Perry described 143 as a dance album: "This record is super high energy, it's super summer, it's very high BPM [8]. We just had a family dance party to one of the songs, and it's just full of so much joy, so much love, so much light." Perry also stated that an acoustic follow-up album was in the works after 143. 143 is a pop,   dance-pop,   and Europop album,  addressing themes around love, motherhood and feminism [9] [10] [11] [69] [13] [11]. During an exclusive interview with Zane Lowe, she explained that the album title is her symbolic "angel" number: "A couple years ago, we were going through a little bit of a hard time medically in our family, and it was a little bit scary, and I started seeing 143 in many different ways, not just, like, on the phone. It was just like trippy, almost. And I looked it up, and it's code for 'I love you.' I really believe it was my angels, my guides, saying, 'I love you. We got you. We're going to protect you. You're exactly where you're meant to be. You're on the path". [c] [15]. 

# Release and promotion

Perry revealed on July 10, 2024, that her seventh album is titled 143 and will be released on September 20, 2024, by Capitol Records, aligned with her headlining live performance at the Rock in Rio Festival, in Brazil. To further excite her fans, she went on a social media livestream that day and teased new songs from the album, including "Nirvana", "Gimme Gimme" featuring 21 Savage, and "I'm His, He's Mine" featuring Doechii, which samples "Gypsy Woman" by Crystal Waters [17]. During her interview with Lowe, Perry shared snippets of two other 143 tracks: "Lifetimes" and "Gorgeous" [9]. The album was available as eight vinyl variants, four CD variants, a cassette tape, and multiple digital download variants with exclusive bonus tracks [18]. Perry conducted a one-off concert, Katy Perry: Night of a Lifetime, on December 11 at the Methodist Central Hall, Westminster in London [20]. The special was recorded and aired on December 21 at ITV1 [21]. 

## Singles

The lead single, "Woman's World", was released on July 11, 2024. The song and its music video were received negatively by critics and the audience [23]. Several journalists attributed it to the "bad taste" of the album's marketing, which they found unhelpful to Perry's perceived commercial decline with Witness and Smile. Perry's collaboration with Dr. Luke, who has been accused of sexual harassment by American singer Kesha, was also widely criticized. The album's second single, "Lifetimes", an Italo house track, was released on August 8, 2024. In its music video, the track list of 143 was revealed. The music video was met with some controversy after Perry was accused of trespassing on ecologically protected dunes by the government of Balearic Islands, Spain, a claim which Perry's record label, Capitol, refuted [25]. Perry performed "I'm His, He's Mine" with Doechii and "Lifetimes" in a medley at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards on September 11,  with "I'm His, He's Mine" being released as a single two days later on September 13 [30]. On the album's release day, Perry performed "Woman's World", "Gimme Gimme", "Gorgeous", "I'm His, He's Mine" and "Lifetimes" at Rock in Rio [31]. Perry performed "Gorgeous" and "Lifetimes" at the 2024 AFL Grand Final on September 28. "OK" was serviced to radio on December 20, 2024, as the album's fourth single in Italy [32] [33] [34]. Both "Lifetimes" and "I'm His, He's Mine" generally underperformed on mainstream charts, instead achieving greater success on airplay charts, reaching the top-forty in multiple countries [35]. "I'm His, He's Mine" became the second single from the album to reach the top-thirty on the Billboard Pop Airplay Chart, after "Woman's World" [11] [36] [37]. 

# Critical reception

143 received negative reception from music critics, being dubbed Perry's worst effort. [d] At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 37, based on 18 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". It marks the lowest-rated album of Perry's career and the lowest-rated album of the 2020s on the website [40]. Reviews generally considered 143 an unimpressive and derivative record from Perry. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian dubbed 143 a mediocre pop album "some way short of total catastrophe."  The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich, Financial Times's Ludovic Hunter-Tilney, and PopMatters' Peter Piatkowski said that Perry has lost the frivolity and "cheeky, cartoonish eccentricity" that used to make her songs "dexterous and funny" [11]. Clash's Robin Murray,  Slant's Tom Williams,  The Times's Ed Potton,  and NME's Nick Levine felt the album was a dull, unsatisfying listen with very little highlights [13] [55] [56] [42] [58]. Tanatat Khuttapan of The Line of Best Fit dubbed 143 an album of "mindless club fillers" while The Daily Telegraph's Helen Brown referred to it as an inept "disastrous" album [59]. Slate's Carl Wilson,  Business Insider's Callie Ahlgrim and The Arts Desk's Guy Oddy said the album has no redeeming songs after its three singles [60] [43] [74]. The outdated production was singled out as a specific point of criticism [62] [63]. Petridis,  Murray,  and Los Angeles Times' Mikael Wood felt that Perry's music does not fit in a pop scene defined by the fresh sounds of newer artists, specifically those like Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan [11] [42]. Multiple critics speculated if artificial intelligence was used in the process of making the album, due to the perceived low quality of content [10]. Chris Kelly of The Washington Post, Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone, and Hunter-Tilney agreed that 143 is a failed attempt in rekindling Perry's prime, resulting in pop music that is "as dated as a Vine". Rich Juzwiak of Pitchfork noted the underperformance of 143 after the commercial failures of Witness (2017) and Smile (2020) and quipped that releasing albums that are so-bad-it's-good could be a part of Perry's appeal [67] [13] [68]. Steven Horowitz from Variety described 143 as a new creative low for Perry, arguing that Perry's decision to reflect on her older catalog to create new music was a bad creative decision [77]. Others felt that 143 confirms Perry's perceived loss of creativity after having been a prominent pop star of the 2010s, with The Spinoff's Stewart Sowman-Lund naming Prism (2013) as Perry's last success [4]. A more positive review came from Billboard author Rania Aniftos, who regarded 143 as a "characteristically Katy Perry" album that her fans are "sure to enjoy". Some reviewers, such as Horowitz, Petridis, and Khuttapan, declared "Wonder" as the best track of the album, complimenting the display of sincere emotion [74]. Hunter-Tilney remarked that "a so-bad-it's-good reassessment" is 143's last resort and pondered if the album could be "reborn as a kitsch classic for its sheer badness" [11] [4] [60]. The album's critical reception was a topic of media coverage. Nick Levine of the BBC opined that the album's reception "may also have been hampered by a toxic combination of misogyny and ageism that tends to affect female artists over 35."  However, Callie Ahlgrim countered this argument and said "the adverse reaction  [to 143] is very much earned, if even a little generous." [75] [62]. 

# Commercial performance

143 debuted at number six on the US Billboard 200 chart, marking Perry's seventh top-ten album. It opened with 48,000 album equivalent units, of which 37,500 were sales, 10,000 were streaming-equivalent units (translated from 13.11 million on-demand streams), and 500 track-equivalent units [76]. It remained on the chart for two weeks, making it Perry's shortest running album to date [20] [77] [78]. Some journalists noted that Perry's perceived commercial decline continued with 143. As of December 2024, the album has sold 100,000 units in the US. [4] [11]. The album fared better in Europe, surpassing the first-week performance of Perry's previous release, Smile (2020), in multiple countries. It debuted at number six on the UK Albums Chart with 9,250 album equivalent units, her best first-week sales in the country since Witness (2017), and became her sixth top-ten album. In Spain, the album entered the albums chart at number three, becoming her highest-charting project in the country since Witness (2017) [79] [80]. Similarly, the album debuted at number six in Italy, beating the number ten peak of Smile (2020) [81]. The album also reached number six and number five on the Belgian Flanders and Wallonia charts, respectively, becoming her fifth consecutive top-ten album in both regions [82]. In Australia, 143 debuted at number two on the ARIA Top 50 Albums Chart, remaining in the top-twenty in its second week, aided by Perry's performance at the 2024 AFL Grand Final. The album also reached the top-ten in New Zealand and Scotland [84].
