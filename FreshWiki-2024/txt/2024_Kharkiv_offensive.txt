2024_Kharkiv_offensive

On 10 May 2024, the Russian Armed Forces began an offensive operation in Ukraine's Kharkiv Oblast, shelling and attempting to breach the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the direction of Vovchansk and Kharkiv. The Guardian reported that the offensive has led to Russia's biggest territorial gains in 18 months. By early June the Russian offensive stalled, with The Guardian reporting that the situation on the frontline had been "stabilized." Ukrainian forces then began small-scale counterattacks, which reportedly recaptured its first settlement on 19 June.
The Russian armed forces have also launched raids into Sumy Oblast, Chernihiv Oblast, and other segments of Kharkiv Oblast, in an effort to draw Ukrainian resources away from the main offensive in Kharkiv. Similarly, Ukrainian forces have launched raids into Belgorod Oblast, while some western analysts attribute the 2024 Kursk offensive as a diversion from Kharkiv.

# Background

On February 24, 2022, the opening day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine 20,000 Russian soldiers commenced an offensive operation south from Belgorod Oblast to capture Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Russian forces quickly captured Vovchansk, before continuing south to Balakliia, Izium, and Shevchenkove in an effort to attack Kharkiv from the north and east [14]. For three days Kharkiv was the site of street fighting until Russian forces withdrew on February 28 under threat of being encircled in the city [15]. Ukraine launched a major counteroffensive to recapture Russian held Kharkiv Oblast in late 2022. Ukraine reestablished control over most of Kharkiv Oblast, except for a small portion in the east between the border with Luhansk Oblast and the Oskil river [18]. Ethnically Russian pro-Ukrainian militias, the Russian Volunteer Corps and Freedom of Russia Legion performed cross-border raids into Kursk and Belgorod in 2023 and again later in 2024. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov repeatedly threatened to attack Kharkiv Oblast and establish a buffer zone to protect Russia's border in response [19] [20]. During the first months of 2024, reports appeared that the Russian army was rebuilding its forces in the north to launch a new offensive in the direction of Kharkiv later that year [21] [22]. On 8 May 2024, the governor of Kharkiv Oblast, Oleh Syniehubov, reported a large gathering of Russian forces north of the region [23] [24] [25]. The secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Oleksandr Lytvynenko, subsequently said that over 50,000 Russian soldiers had been deployed to the border [26] [27]. 

# Offensive

## Early Russian offensive

### 10 May

According to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Russian forces shelled positions with guided bombs in the direction of Vovchansk during the day and added artillery fire at night. An attempt to break through the front line was recorded at 5:00 am on 10 May. Up to 4–5 Russian infantry battalions from a newly created force  crossed the state border, reportedly capturing the villages of Krasne, Borysivka, Strilecha, and Pylna [29] [30]. Ukraine's armed forces urged residents of northern Kharkiv Oblast to evacuate [29] [31] [32]. The secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Oleksandr Lytvynenko, subsequently said that over 30,000 Russian soldiers were involved in the offensive [33] [45]. Communication in the Ukrainian military was temporarily disrupted due to Starlink devices having been knocked out [28]. According to Ukrainian military journalist Yuri Butusov, the captured border area had been a "gray zone" behind the Ukrainian defensive line with no Ukrainian military presence, with the exception of Strilecha. Syniehubov also referred to the affected villages as a "gray zone",  claiming that "the Ukrainian armed forces have not lost a single meter" [31] [36] [37]. According to DeepStateMap.Live analysts, citing confidential sources, Russian forces had occupied the village of Pylna several days before 10 May, but poor communication within the Ukrainian military had prevented any action from being taken [38]. Later in the afternoon, reserve units were sent to Kharkiv Oblast to hold the front line, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that artillery had thus far been able to repel the Russian offensive in Kharkiv Oblast and that Russia may pull more reserves to support the offensive but that Ukraine's armed forces were ready to resist them. Later that day a senior Ukrainian commander said that Russian forces had pushed Ukrainian forces back by one kilometer from the Russian-Ukrainian border and were aiming to advance 10 kilometers into Ukraine. The border city of Vovchansk was subjected to "massive shelling" and residents were evacuated. Fighting was also reported in the villages of Pletenivka  [uk], Hatyshche,  Hoptivka,  Morokhovets,  Oliinykove and Ohirtseve  [uk] [43] [44] [45]. Russian bloggers claimed that Pletenivka, Hatyshche, Ohirtseve and Zelene had come under Russian control [46]. Ukraine's 42nd Mechanized Brigade published footage of its "Perun" unit destroying four Russian BMP infantry fighting vehicles in the area of Pylna using combat drones, claiming to have inflicted several casualties [47]. A member of the Ukrainian partisan movement Atesh allegedly serving in the Russian military claimed that parts of his unit, a motorised rifle battalion of the 44th Army Corps, refused to participate in the assault on Kharkiv Oblast, owing to the failure of previous sabotage and reconnaissance and the strength of Ukrainian fortifications. By 10 May, Russian forces, according to the ISW, had seized around "35 square miles of territory". 

### 11 May

According to the ISW, geolocated footage published on 11 May indicated that Morokhovets, Oliinykove and Ohirtseve had come under Russian control. Russian military bloggers claimed that Russian forces had also captured the villages of Hoptivka, Kudiivka  [uk] and Tykhe, and were trying to advance into Vovchansk, though the think tank said it had not observed evidence to verify these claims [53] [54].

Two days later, they also claimed to have captured six Russians after repulsing another assault, also near Vovchansk [195]. 

# Analysis

The offensive comes at a time when the limited Ukrainian troops were already stretched across a 1,000+ km frontline, forcing partial troop pull backs from other areas such as Kupiansk. Observers assessed that Ukraine appeared to be ill-prepared for the offensive despite official denials [197]. Noting a small buildup of Russian forces near Sumy Oblast, Kiev warned that the current operation may be a precursor to a larger summer offensive [198]. In a Reuters article, Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with the Black Bird Group, also assessed that the Kharkiv push aimed to deplete limited Ukrainian reserves before a main offensive. Notably, he said: "If Ukraine overcommits in Kharkiv and Sumy, they may preserve some territory there, perhaps prevent Kharkiv civilians from suffering artillery bombardments, perhaps even push back the enemy back to the border, but it may cost them the war, if the reserves are not available to respond to crises during the Russian summer offensive."  In a lighter tone, David Axe, a military correspondent for Forbes, suggested that the offensive might be "an elaborate feint" whose main goal was to pull Ukrainian resources away from Chasiv Yar and the area of Avdiivka [197]. On 28 May, the Institute for the Study of War reported attacks east of Chasiv Yar and Novopokrovske, as well as attacks near Novomykhailivka and Staromaiorske, all of which are in Donetsk Oblast. All four attacks were considered by the ISW to have likely been intended to test Ukrainian response after the Kharkiv offensive; they failed to make any meaningful gain. The decision by US president Joe Biden in late May to allow firing US-supplied weapons into Russian territory to defend Kharkiv was seen by observers as having allowed Ukraine to very quickly stem the Russian offensive, and gain time to bring in troops from the southern and eastern fronts. By July 6, Russian milbloggers began to critically denounce the offensive's leadership, claiming that Russian forces are far from achieving their objective of creating a 15-kilometer buffer zone and that Russian forces are struggling with coordination in the Vovchansk direction. These milbloggers also pointed out that Russian forces have already suffered a third of the casualties that Russian forces suffered in their four-month campaign to seize Avdiivka [135]. Milbloggers conclude that this is the result of the poor leadership and tactical skills of Colonel General Alexander Lapin, commander of the Russian Northern Grouping of Forces [135]. 

# Reactions

On 25 May 2024, the Ukrainian State Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation into the Ukrainian army's 125th Brigade and its subordinate units for failing to "properly organize the defense of positions on the border of Kharkiv Oblast" due to a "careless attitude to military service". On 30 May 2024, US president Biden gave Ukraine permission to strike targets inside Russia near Kharkiv Oblast using American-supplied weapons. The same permission was given to Ukraine by Germany,  France and the United Kingdom [202] [203]. On 8 June 2024, Ukrainian president Zelenskyy said in his evening address that Russia had failed its Kharkiv offensive despite on-going fighting in the area. On 9 June 2024, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that Russia's advance in the area had "stalled out". 

# Military casualty claims

The Ukrainian's Khortytsia group claimed on 10 June that Russia lost 4,000 soldiers killed and injured over the past month.They also claimed to have damaged or destroyed 52 Russian tanks, 59 armored vehicles, 165 artillery systems, six units of air defense equipment. However, an undisclosed NATO official estimated that "Russia likely suffered losses of almost 1,000 people a day in May," referring to the number of fatalities (allegedly "calculated" at over 30,000), potentially indicating even higher numbers than those presented by the Khortytsia group. On 10 July, Ukraine's Kharkiv OTP group made an estimate claiming that out of 10,350 Russian troops deployed, 2,939 soldiers had been killed and 6,509 had been wounded in action, losses of approximately 91%. Additionally, 45 Russian troops have been captured as of early July. Russia's 83rd Air Assault Brigade was claimed to be "constantly suffering losses" of "several dozen people a day". On 21 July, President Zelenskyy gave a much higher claim of Russians killed, saying that "their maximum depth of incursion was 10 kilometres from the border [210]. We stopped them. Approximately 20,000 people died." In that same interview, he claimed that the ratio of killed and wounded soldiers "in" Russia is 1 to 3. As of 21 June, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that Ukraine suffered 9,845 losses, including killed and wounded, in at least 9 brigades in the Kharkiv direction since the start of the offensive. It also said that 28 tanks, 46 armored combat vehicles, 30 MLRS combat vehicles, 5 air defense vehicles and 6 EW stations from Ukraine, among other equipment, were destroyed in the time period. [citation needed]. On 6 July, Russian milbloggers reported that the Russian forces in Kharkiv have lost around a third of the casualties that Russia lost during the Battle of Avdiivka. The Ukrainian 71st Jaeger Brigade claimed that they had killed or wounded 1,200 Russian soldiers near Vovchansk in August. 

# Impact on civilians

The governor of Kharkiv Oblast reported that, as of 20 May 2024, more than 10,500 residents have been evacuated from areas of Kharkiv Oblast affected by the fighting,  particularly in Kharkiv, Bohodukhiv and Chuhuiv raions [215]. By 14 May, only about 400 civilians remained in Vovchansk, with "almost none" in the northern part of the city [216]. Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko claimed on 16 May that a resident of Vovchansk had been killed by Russian soldiers after refusing to obey their orders and attempting to escape on foot. He also said that other civilians were being forced into basements. A video shot by aerial reconnaissance over Vovchansk showed the body of a dead civilian man in a wheelchair in the middle of a road near a local hospital that had been occupied by Russian forces. Law enforcement officials reported they opened a proceeding to investigate the circumstances of the death. On 7 June, the regional governor of Sumy Oblast Volodymyr Artyukh ordered the evacuation of 8 border settlements in Sumy Oblast. 

## Allegations of war crimes

Ukrainian police claimed on 17 May that up to 40 civilians, mostly elderly, were being interrogated by people who were calling themselves FSB employees, and alleged that they were being used as human shields by Russian forces, a claim which has not been independently verified. Furthermore, a Ukrainian military spokesman claimed that Russian forces were looting houses of local residents on the outskirts of Vovchansk,  with a video published on Telegram showing a Russian soldier taking a large covered object into a UAZ-3303 truck, purportedly looting [223]. [better source needed] [224]. On June 9, a Ukrainian serviceman reported that Russian forces were attempting to attack positions in Vovchansk while in civilian clothes, hiding machine-guns under said civilian clothes, which constitutes perfidy, a war-crime per Articles 37, 38 and 39 of the Geneva convention.
