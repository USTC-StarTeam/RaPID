# Production

## Development

At Disney's biennial D23 Expo convention in August 2019, Kathryn Hahn was revealed to be cast in the role of Agnes, Wanda Maximoff and Vision's neighbor, in the Marvel Studios Disney+ television series WandaVision (2021). That series' seventh episode reveals that "Agnes" is actually Agatha Harkness, a powerful witch from Marvel Comics . In May 2021, WandaVision head writer Jac Schaeffer signed a three-year overall television deal with Marvel Studios and 20th Television to develop additional projects for the studios' Disney+ slate . In pitches for several different projects centered on various characters, Schaeffer kept suggesting that Agatha be included as part of those series . This led to her and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige pursuing a series centered on that character instead. By October 2021, a "dark comedy" spin-off from WandaVision centered on Hahn as Agatha was in early development for Disney+ from Marvel Studios,  with Schaeffer returning from WandaVision as head writer and executive producer [38] [11] [4]. Hahn's involvement was part of a larger deal she signed with Marvel Studios to reprise her role in series and films [4] [3]. During a Disney+ Day event in November 2021, the series was officially announced. Schaeffer was revealed to be directing episodes of the series a year later,  and Gandja Monteiro was revealed as another director in December 2022,  along with Rachel Goldberg in January 2023 [3] [40] [41]. Each directed three episodes of the series [26]. By October 2023, Marvel Studios was changing its approach to television, hiring more traditional showrunners instead of head writers;  Schaeffer was being credited as the series' showrunner by July 2024 [22] [42]. Brad Winderbaum, the head of streaming, television, and animation at Marvel Studios, said Agatha All Along was the studio's least expensive series, costing less than the $40 million budget of Echo (2024), and he attributed this to the series' use of practical effects rather than computer-generated imagery [43]. Marvel Studios' Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Mary Livanos also served as executive producers [1]. The series is being released under Marvel Studios' "Marvel Television" label [43]. Actress Debra Jo Rupp, who returned from WandaVision, described the spin-off as being a second season of WandaVision in an anthology sense, similar to the different seasons of the television series American Horror Story (2011–present) [44]. Agatha All Along is intended to be second in a trilogy of series that includes WandaVision and Vision Quest (2026) [45]. 

### Title

The series was initially announced with the title Agatha: House of Harkness,  but was renamed to Agatha: Coven of Chaos by July 2022 [3]. The series was revealed to have been retitled once again in September 2023, this time to Agatha: Darkhold Diaries [47]. Actress Aubrey Plaza had previously posted a photo in May 2023 of a director's chair with that title, in a font based on the one used for the Disney film The Princess Diaries (2001) [48]. Adam B [49]. Vary at Variety reported that the multiple title changes were not caused by indecision from Marvel Studios and were instead indicating that the main character was "up to her old skulduggery",  and he said it was possible that the series was simply titled Agatha;  that is what the series was referred to as in a filing for the first episode with the United States Copyright Office as well as on the official Disney+ website [50] [51]. In May 2024, Marvel Studios released a new logo on Twitter with the title Agatha: The Lying Witch with Great Wardrobe, but took down the post soon after. Germain Lussier at Gizmodo thought this may have been a joke or a mistake and noted that it was referencing the C. S. Lewis novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950). He felt it was "the worst title of the bunch" despite being accurate to the character, and questioned why the series had received so many publicly announced titles during development. He felt the best choice would be Agatha All Along,  referring to the 'theme song' of the same name used when Agatha was revealed as the true villain in WandaVision [55]. The next day, Disney announced at an upfront presentation that the official title was Agatha All Along,   and released a video showing that the changing titles were "orchestrated by  [Agatha] as a way of messing with Marvel fans" [56] [57] [58]. Schaeffer and the writers conceived the various titles [59]. Livanos enjoyed releasing "crazier and crazier" titles throughout the marketing stunt and felt it was appropriate for Agatha. 

## Writing

Laura Donney, Cameron Squires, Giovanna Sarquis, Laura Monti, Jason Rostovsky, Gia King, and Peter Cameron served as writers on the series, alongside Schaeffer. Squires, Cameron, Donney, and Monti all returned from WandaVision,   alongside Megan McDonnell, who was a consulting producer, serving as the on-set writer [61] [62] [63]. Monti had served as Schaeffer's assistant on WandaVision, aiding in the creation of the acclaimed line "What is grief, if not love persevering?"  King and Rostovsky contributed to the writing process with their respective interests in divination and gothic horror [64] [65]. Livanos said the chance to continue Agatha Harkness's story and to get to know the character further was "immediately an imperative" for the creatives [66]. Winderbaum compared Agatha All Along to Marvel Studios' series Loki (2021–2023), because they both feature antiheroes, are different from the studios' other series, and explore similar emotional depths for their title characters [5]. Winderbaum called Agatha All Along a "Halloween show" that features a "Marvel brand of scary" with deadly stakes, while still being fun and dramatic [67]. Feige likened Agatha All Along to the film The Goonies (1985) [68]. Comics that influenced the series included Scarlet Witch vol [7]. 2 by James Robinson that introduced the Witches' Road, Agatha Harkness's early appearances in Fantastic Four, and The Vision and the Scarlet Witch vol. 2. : 7:57–8:22 [6]. Schaeffer said Agatha All Along would follow Agatha as she is joined by "a disparate, mixed bag of witches" who are all coven-less, explaining that the series would explore what happens when these witches, who are "defined by deception, treachery, villainy and selfishness", are forced to work together. She also noted that the series plays with witch lore and assumptions about them, in a similar way to how WandaVision played with the sitcom format,  looking to have "a similar mechanism and involve pastiche" as that series did [17]. Schaeffer was able to define witchcraft within the MCU with the series [18]. The first episode sees Agatha in a true crime drama as a detective, in an homage to the HBO miniseries Mare of Easttown (2021). As Agatha and her coven travel the Witches' Road, each of its trials alters the attire of the coven to "emulate a particular kind of witch from pop culture": "WASP-y east coast women in collared shirts" which Schaeffer described as "coastal grandma chic" who are "backstabbing and duplicitous", drawing from Practical Magic (1998); a "Fleetwood Mac-style band" drawing from singer Stevie Nicks' "white witch" era and the film Season of the Witch (1972); and 1980s summer camp attire using a ouija board [11]. The series also draws from other well-known portrayals of witches, such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Maleficent (2014), incorporating visual cues and narrative elements inspired by these films. Early attempts at creating the trials were elemental based, which did not allow for the infusion of illusion or pop culture or the creativity from the costume and production design [69]. Agatha All Along is set in 2026, three years after the events of WandaVision,  which saw Agatha trapped in her "Agnes" persona by Wanda Maximoff [70]. However, the spell has now become distorted because of Maximoff's death in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) and the Teen's intervention. Following the abundance of fan theories and speculation on WandaVision that ultimately were not intended for that series, Schaeffer was more careful with her language in Agatha All Along to still be able to protect some of the series' surprises while hoping it would not create expectations in the fandom that would not come to fruition,  dismissing such as Thanos appearing due to his backstory with Death in the source material, with Schaeffer intending to just leave some of Death's characterization for interpretation in the show [71] [72]. 

## Casting

Hahn was expected to reprise her role in the series with the reveal of its development in October 2021,  which was confirmed with the series' official announcement a month later [4]. Emma Caulfield Ford revealed in October 2022 that she would reprise her role as Sarah Proctor / "Dottie Jones" from WandaVision [3]. In November, Joe Locke,  Aubrey Plaza,  Ali Ahn, Maria Dizzia,  and Sasheer Zamata joined the cast [74] [75] [76] [77].

Miles Gutierrez-Riley was cast as Teen's boyfriend,    with Okwui Okpokwasili also cast in the series as Salem Seven member Vertigo [26] [28] [27] [22] [26] [20]. The series reveals that "Teen" is actually Billy Maximoff, who was previously portrayed by Julian Hilliard in WandaVision and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness [22] [26]. 

## Design

Daniel Selon served as the costume designer, after previously working as an assistant costume designer on WandaVision, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and Thor: Love and Thunder (2022). John Collins was the production designer [83]. The different witches in Agatha's coven all have their own styles which were categorized by Gordon Jackson of Gizmodo as the goth, the clairvoyant, the hippie, and the "coastal grandmother" [84].

Filming with Rupp also occurred in Los Angeles by February 2023, before moving to Atlanta for two months [87]. The start of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike in May 2023 was not expected to impact production of Agatha All Along, with Marvel Studios reportedly planning to shoot what they could during principal photography and make any necessary writing adjustments during the series' already scheduled reshoots [45]. Plaza filmed some of her scenes concurrent with the last two weeks of her commitments to the film Megalopolis (2024), also in Atlanta [91]. Filming took place on Blondie Street at the Warner Bros [79]. Ranch for Agatha's house and other Westview exteriors prior to the street being demolished. Hahn stated that filming used as many practical elements as possible, including practical magic opposed to having it done through CGI. Livano said this was done to be an homage to the golden age of fantasy and horror films, using many in-camera effects such as backdrops, miniatures, special effects, makeup effects, and creature effects [92]. The creatives wanted Agatha All Along to elicit similar nostalgic feelings for the audience as WandaVision had with that series' homage to sitcoms. : 8:54–9:16  Filming wrapped by May 28 [6]. Hahn said in January 2024 there were a few days left of reshoots to take place,  which were completed in one day in early February [93] [94].

In March, Christophe Beck revealed that he would be returning from WandaVision and other MCU media to compose the score for the series [56]. The following month, Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez were revealed to have written the series' original songs, also returning from WandaVision [99]. Hahn serves as the lead singer for some songs, with the other witch actors such as LuPone acting as background singers. Schaeffer wanted to work with the composers to find a way to weave whatever songs they came up with into the series' narrative [100]. : 10:44–11:06  One of their songs, "The Ballad of the Witches' Road",  became an ancient tune in the series that all witches are familiar with [6] [101]. : 10:44–11:06  In September 2024, Michael Paraskevas was revealed to have composed the score with Beck, after previously working together in the MCU series Hawkeye (2021) [6].

# Marketing

A first-look at the series was included in the bonus features of WandaVision's physical home media, which was released in late November 2023. Hahn, Locke, and LuPone promoted the series at Disney's May 2024 upfront presentation, where the release date and official title were announced and the first trailer was shown [5].

## Critical response

The series holds an 84% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 211 critic reviews with an average rating of 7.25/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "The marvelous Kathryn Hahn is backed up by a coven of memorable performers in this MCU spinoff that refreshingly concocts its own distinct brew."  Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, gave the series a score of 66 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews [145]. Writing for the Rolling Stone, Alan Sepinwall noted that the series "works as a proper TV show rather than a chopped-up movie," while David Fear lauded the self-contained nature of the narrative, claiming it aligned with Disney+ output better than various other Marvel Studios properties. Eliana Dockterman of Time felt that showrunner Jac Schaeffer "seems to be one of the few writers working in the superhero realm who understands that emotional revelations are far more compelling than CGI magic," and wrote that "the greatest trick of Agatha All Along is that the show used its extended time on the small screen to make us empathize with Agatha and Billy."  Lucy Mangan of The Guardian gave the show a grade of 5 out of 5, and lauded its exploration of multiple genres, stating, "This royally entertaining Marvel series slips seamlessly from comedy to tragedy."  The performances of Hahn, Locke, LuPone and Plaza were all praised by critics [155] [156] [157] [158]. Hahn received particular recognition for her portrayal of Agatha Harkness, with Fear claiming the role was "pitched right in the actor’s  [Hahn's] sweet spot, between acerbic wit and rapidly approaching a nervous breakdown."  Managan wrote, "Kathryn Hahn is so good you can barely take your eyes off her" and commended the supporting cast, concluding that "although it remains indubitably Hahn's show  [...] she is surrounded by excellence." [159] [160] [156] [153] [151] [156] [158]. The series garnered praise for its portrayal of queer themes and characters. Valerie Anne of Autostraddle noted that "queerness has been a thread in the tapestry of this show from the start, not only because of the inherent queerness of witches, but because of the presence of queer actors and queer subtext."  Writing for The Evening Standard, Deeya Sonalkar deemed Agatha All Along to be "the queerest MCU outing by far", which she described as "a welcome change" [161] [162] [163] [164] [165]. Salon critic Kelly McClure praised the series for not falling into the pattern of queerbaiting, and highlighted Hahn and Plaza's chemistry [149]. Variety critic Alison Herman similarly wrote, "The mood is more referential and camp-adjacent than its franchise peers [160]. In other words, it’s more gay, a style that’s quickly matched with substance." [159]. In a mixed review, Rob Owen of The Seattle Times opined that although Hahn's "chemistry with Locke and Plaza, especially, makes Agatha watchable," the show "is not as creative as WandaVision and threatens to feature the same plot over and over, episode after episode."  USA Today's Kelly Lawler criticised the series' uneven tone, but praised the performances and the humor, writing, "Agatha is trying to do too many things at once [166]. Buried deep somewhere is a good horror series about Agatha's journey with real scares and perhaps a mythology that's understandable. But in true Marvel fashion, more and more stuff just keeps getting piled on the base story. [...] They  [the cast] all seem to be having fun, and it can be contagious. If confusing." [167]. 

## Accolades

Hahn's performance was an honorable mention for TVLine's Performer of the Week for the week ending October 12, 2024, with Rebecca Iannucci stating, "Kathryn Hahn has one of the most formidable acting ranges in the business" and commending her for "her comedy chops  [...] and her subtle dramatic skill".

Matt Webb Mitovich lauded his layered performance, writing that "Joe Locke worked all kinds of magic with the variety of material given him".
