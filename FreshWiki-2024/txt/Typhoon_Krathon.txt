Typhoon_Krathon

Typhoon Krathon, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Julian, was a powerful and erratic tropical cyclone which impacted Taiwan and the Philippines in late September and early October 2024. Krathon, which refers to the santol fruit, was the first storm to make landfall on Taiwan's densely populated western plains since Typhoon Thelma in 1977. It was also the first storm to hit Kaohsiung in October and the first since Tropical Storm Trami in 2001 to weaken into a tropical depression over Taiwan. Additionally, it was the wettest tropical cyclone in Basco, Batanes, bringing more than two months' worth of rainfall for September and surpassing the previous record set by  Typhoon Ruth in 1991.
The eighteenth named storm, the second violent typhoon of the season, and the second super typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Krathon developed into a tropical depression near Kadena Air Base, Japan, on September 26, and was classified as a tropical storm by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) on September 28 as it moved southwestward along the southeastern periphery. Krathon reached minimal typhoon status on September 29 after developing a broad, ragged eye. The typhoon moved north-northwestward between two subtropical highs before shifting west-northwestward and passing near Sabtang, Batanes. Early on October 1, the JMA reported that the storm had reached its peak intensity, with ten-minute  sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a central pressure of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg). It subsequently peaked as a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with one-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph). As Krathon moved into the northern South China Sea, an eyewall replacement cycle began, which was evident in radar imagery, with the secondary eyewall nearly encircling the inner eye. Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Krathon began warming cloud tops and displayed a weakened cloud-filled eye feature that caused upwelling and a decrease in ocean heat content. On October 3, Krathon made landfall near Siaogang District in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, with its spiral bands of deep convection gradually weakening as it moved north-northeastward into central Taiwan, near the western edge of the Central Mountain Range. After making landfall, the system rapidly slowed down and deteriorated, exhibiting minimal convective activity. The JMA continued to monitor the system as it emerged over the South China Sea before dissipating on the same day.
Ahead of the storm, a Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal was issued for various areas in the Philippines, with a red alert for Calayan and Santa Ana in Cagayan. Krathon resulted in at least five deaths, three people missing, and eight injured in the Philippines. Meanwhile, Taiwan's Central Weather Administration issued maritime warnings for the Bashi Channel, leading to the evacuation of more than 11,000 people and the mobilization of nearly 40,000 soldiers for rescue efforts; at least 13 people were killed across the island, including nine from the Antai Tian-Sheng Memorial Hospital fire in Pingtung County. Overall, 18 people were killed, 731 were injured and one was missing by Krathon, leaving at least US$48.1 million in damages.

# Meteorological history

The origins of Typhoon Krathon can be traced back to September 26, when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported a tropical depression 250 km (155 mi) south-southwest of Kadena Air Base, Japan,  characterised by a partially exposed low-level circulation centre with persistent deep convection in the southern semicircle and formative banding to the north [1]. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on September 27, noting that convective banding was wrapping into the centre and that the environmental analysis indicated a favourable environment for development due to low vertical wind shear, good equatorward outflow aloft, and warm sea surface temperatures of 29–30 °C (84–86 °F) [2] [3]. On that same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) announced that the system had developed into a tropical depression  named Julian, as it formed within the Philippine Area of Responsibility;  the depression was moving slowly south-southwestward due to weak steering flow [4] [5]. At 09:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded the tropical depression, designating the system as 20W, noting an obscured low-level circulation centre that was assumed to be in the centre of rotating bands of convection organising into vortical hot towers. Satellite imagery indicated that the storm was steadily consolidating, with spiral bands of deep convection extending across three quadrants of the system and encircling the low-level circulation centre [7]. On September 28, the depression intensified into a tropical storm named Krathon by the JMA, fueled by low vertical wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures, and high ocean heat content, while moving southwestward along the southeastern periphery of a mid-level subtropical high;  however, Krathon slowed down over the last six hours and was located within a col region between two deep-layer subtropical high,  with satellite imagery indicating an improving appearance due to the development of a central dense overcast feature over the circulation centre [8] [9] [10]. At around 18:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm, utilizing the Dvorak technique to assess its intensity based on satellite imagery. Krathon displayed strong equatorward outflow alongside a weaker polar channel, while the observed cirrus cloud suggested that a more radial outflow was beginning to develop as the system intensified [12]. Early the next day, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded it to a minimal typhoon after it had opened a broad, raggedly-defined eye,   which had since become cloud-filled, and the system was moving north-northwestward between two mid-level subtropical high [13] [14] [15]. On September 30, the eye of the typhoon, measuring 23 miles (37 km) in diameter, was visible on infrared satellite imagery,  surrounded by warm temperatures of 54–57 °F (12–14 °C),  as the storm gradually moved west-northwestward and passed near Sabtang, Batanes [16] [17] [18]. The typhoon displayed a distinct circular shape in the cloud tops across the eyewall region, with a contracting eye that was obscured in the center [19]. At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC reported that the system had peaked as a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon after Krathon attained 1-minute sustained winds of  240 km/h (150 mph) [20]. Early on October 1, the JMA upgraded Krathon to a violent typhoon, estimating its peak intensity with a minimum central pressure of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg) and 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) [34]. As it moved into the northern area of the South China Sea,  the cloud top temperatures of Krathon sharply decreased over the past six hours amid warm conditions [34]. An eyewall replacement cycle became apparent in radar imagery, with the secondary eyewall almost completely encircling the inner eye [34]. Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Krathon began warming cloud tops and displayed a weakened cloud-filled eye feature that caused upwelling and a decrease in ocean heat content,  and it was moving southwest of Taiwan, located between a subtropical ridge to the east and another ridge over southern China and northern Vietnam [34] [34]. The following day, satellite imagery revealed that the system remained symmetrical; however, warming cloud tops became exposed due to increasing vertical wind shear [34]. On October 3 at 12:40 p.m [34]. local time, Krathon made landfall near Siaogang District in Kaohsiung, Taiwan,  with its spiral bands of deep convection gradually weakening as it moved north-northeastward into central Taiwan, near the western edge of the Central Mountain Range [29]. This made Krathon the first storm to make landfall on Taiwan's densely populated western plains since Typhoon Thelma in 1977 [34]. After making landfall, the system rapidly slowed down and deteriorated, exhibiting minimal convective activity and ultimately weakening to a minimal tropical storm [31] [32]. The JTWC discontinued warnings on the system as it moved inland, where the rugged southeastern mountain ranges of Taiwan eroded much of the deep convection associated with the circulation center as it weakened to a tropical depression [34]. The Central Weather Administration noted that Krathon was the first storm to hit Kaohsiung in October,  and the first since Tropical Storm Trami in 2001 to weaken into a tropical depression over Taiwan [34] [35]. The JMA continued to monitor the system as it emerged into the South China Sea,  where it remained nearly stationary between two mid-level subtropical high before dissipating on the same day [36] [37]. 

# Preparations

## Philippines

Between September 30 and October 1, the PAGASA station in Basco, Batanes recorded 727.8 millimetres (28.7 in) of rain, exceeding two months' worth for September and breaking the previous record for the wettest cyclone in the area, which was 616.4 millimetres (24.3 in) during Typhoon Ruth (Trining) in 1991. Rain totals in the country were 481.6 mm (18.96 in) in Laoag, 201.5 mm (7.93 in) in Calayan, Cagayan, and 120.0 mm (4.72 in) in Baguio. At least 26 families were displaced by floods in Abra [60]. Landslides also blocked roads in La Union, Abra, Apayao  and Mountain Province [61] [62]. Five airports suspended operations in northern Luzon [63]. Two light aircraft parked at Basco Airport were damaged by strong winds, while Laoag International Airport sustained minor damage. Flooding also affected the runways of Lingayen and Vigan Airports. Operations were also suspended at San Fernando and Baguio Airports due to clouds and low visibility. Seven seaports also suspended operations, while 99 sections of road and three bridges were rendered impassable [64] [65]. Batanes governor Marilou Cayco said that it could take two months for the province to recover from the storm [66]. The Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office distributed 3,000 food packs to Ilocos Norte residents impacted by Typhoon Krathon. The United States government, through the US Marines,  provided emergency aid and air transport support in response to the devastation caused by Krathon, particularly in Batanes [68] [69]. The United States has deployed personnel and aircraft to the Philippines to aid relief efforts in Batanes following Typhoon Krathon, with two Lockheed Martin KC-130 aircraft from the III Marine Expeditionary Force transporting personnel and equipment to Villamor Air Base in Pasay [70]. The United States government, through USAID, allocated $500,000 to aid those affected by Krathon in Batanes,  while the Department of Defense deployed military assets to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Office of Civil Defense in delivering humanitarian supplies to the area [71] [72]. The Philippine Air Force mobilized its PZL W-3 Sokół helicopter to provide emergency supplies and personnel as part of the government's continued relief efforts for the typhoon-affected areas in Batanes [73]. Meanwhile, the USS Boxer (LHD-4) and its 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit arrived in the Philippines to support relief efforts following Typhoon Krathon [74]. On October 4, President Bongbong Marcos inspected affected areas in Batanes and Ilocos Norte [75]. 58 areas have been declared in a state of calamity,  including Ilocos Norte, Batanes, and Cagayan [76] [48]. due to the severe impact of the storm [77]. As of October 18, 2024 [update], the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported that a total of 380,778 people were affected,  with 11 displaced from their homes [80]. Power outages occurred in 20 cities, water outages were reported in three, and telecommunications outages were reported in eight municipalities. A total of 2,843 houses were damaged, while 127 others were destroyed. Five people were killed, twelve were injured, and one was missing [81]. In Batanes, 276 houses were destroyed, while 2,048 others were damaged [48]. Total damages to infrastructure reached ₱965.18 million (US$19.6 million),  while agricultural damages amounted to ₱607.38 million (US$12.33 million)  affecting 17,344.94 hectares (42,860.3 acres) of crops,  resulting in overall damages of ₱1.57 billion (US$31.93 million) [82] [48] [80] [83]. The government gave out relief aid worth ₱21.59 million (US$438,340.61)  and dispatched a C-130 transport aircraft to deliver aid and evacuate some 200 people stranded in Batanes [66]. 

## Taiwan

The outer rain bands of Krathon triggered mudslides that blocked parts of the Suhua Highway in Hualien County on September 30. A temple was damaged in a mudslide in Rueifang, New Taipei City [94]. At least 12 garbage collection vehicles were damaged in a landslide at the Tianwaitian waste recycling incineration plant in Keelung [95]. The Ju Ming Museum in Jinshan District, New Taipei was flooded, stranding its staff [96]. In Donggang Township in Pingtung County, one of the blocks of Antai Tian-Sheng Memorial Hospital caught fire, killing nine people [97]. One person died in Hualien County from a fall while trimming trees  while another died in Taitung County after his vehicle crashed into fallen rocks [98] [99]. At least 719 people were injured throughout the island,  while two persons went missing in New Taipei City and were later found dead [100] [102]. At least 9,499 disaster-related incidents were reported across the island [102]. A total of 436,634 households lost electricity  while 404,673 households lost access to water [104]. The cargo ship Blue Lagoon sprang a leak in the engine room and was abandoned [105]. Its 19 crew were rescued by Taiwan Coast Guard helicopters around 18 miles (29 km) southwest of Orchid Island, after which the vessel drifted ashore on the island. Damages to agriculture reached NT$498.6 million (US$16.2 million)  with Kaohsiung and Pingtung County being the most affected [106] [107] [108]. The government pledged subsidies and loans to affected businesses [104]. Typhoons typically strike the east coast, but Krathon was unusual as it hit the west coast, prompting Taiwan's media to describe it as a "weird" storm [109]. At least 124 incidents of flooding were reported across Taiwan, primarily affecting Kaohsiung and Keelung,  prompting the deployment of approximately 1,500 soldiers in Kaohsiung and neighboring Pingtung to assist with typhoon relief efforts [110] [111]. Keelung's single-day rainfall reached 408 millimetres (16.1 in), breaking the previous record of 351.3 millimetres (13.8 in), set on September 23, 1980 [112]. Record-breaking rainfall totals were also observed, with 1,713.5 millimetres (67.5 in) on Lijialin Road in Taitung, 1,570 millimetres (61.8 in) on Dananshan in Pingtung, and 1,067.5 millimetres (42.0 in) in Ruifang, New Taipei City.
