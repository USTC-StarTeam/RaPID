2024_Bangladesh_quota_reform_movement

The 2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement was a series of anti-government and pro-democracy protests in Bangladesh, spearheaded primarily by university students. Initially focused on restructuring quota-based systems for government job recruitment, the movement expanded against what many perceived as an authoritarian government when they carried out the July massacre of protestors and civilians, most of whom were students. Started as a student movement, the movement later escalated into a fully-fledged mass uprising known as the Student–People's uprising.
The protest began in June 2024, in response to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh reinstating a 30% quota for descendants of freedom fighters, reversing the government decision made in response to the 2018 Bangladesh quota reform movement. Students began to feel like they have a limited opportunity based on merit. The protest quickly spread throughout the entire country because of the government's violent response, as well as growing public dissatisfaction against an oppressive government. The situation was further complicated by many other ongoing issues, like the government's inability to manage a prolonged economic downturn, reports of rampant corruption and human rights violations, and the absence of democratic channels for initiating changes.
The government sought to suppress the protests by shutting down all educational institutions. They deployed their student wing, the Chhatra League, along with other factions of the Awami League party. These groups resorted to using firearms and sharp weapons against the demonstrators. The government then deployed Police, RAB, BGB and other armed forces,  declaring a nationwide shoot-at-sight curfew amid an unprecedented government-ordered nationwide internet and mobile connectivity blackout that effectively isolated Bangladesh from the rest of the world. Later, the government also blocked social media in Bangladesh. Government forces cordoned of parts of the capital city of Dhaka and conducted Block Raids, randomly picking up anyone they suspected having links to the protest, causing fear among the city residents.  As of August 2, there were 215 confirmed deaths, more than 20,000 injuries, and more than 11,000 arrests. The unofficial death toll was between 300 and 500. UNICEF reported that at least 32 children were killed during July's protests, with many more injured and detained. Determining the exact number of deaths has been difficult because the government reportedly restricted hospitals from sharing information with the media without police permission, hospital CCTV footage was confiscated, and numerous individuals with gunshot wounds were buried without identification.
The Awami League government, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina have suggested that political opponents have co-opted the protest. Despite the curfew restrictions the movement remained ongoing as it expanded its demands to include accountability for violence, a ban on the student wing of the government Chhatra League, and resignation of certain government officials, including the resignation of Prime Minister Hasina. The government's use of widespread violence against the general public turned the student protest into a people's uprising known as the non-cooperation movement.

# Background

After the High Court ruled in favor of quotas on 5 June 2024, the students of various universities in Dhaka united to demand quota reform. After the movement was initially started, it was postponed due to Eid al-Adha and the summer holidays. After the holidays, the agitation started again peacefully but gradually became widespread. Initially, the students and teachers of many public universities and other educational institutions joined the movement. Later, the students of private universities also followed suit by joining the public demonstration [114]. Under the banner of Anti-discrimination Students Movement (Bengali: বৈষম্যবিরোধী ছাত্র আন্দোলন), students started the Bangla Blockade [115]. During the movement, the Appellate Division issued a status quo for four weeks on 10 July, canceling the freedom fighters' quota. Reacting to the court verdict, the students said they are seeking a final solution to the quota issue from the government, claiming the movement has nothing to do with the court. The protest also affected the domestic train and road transportation networks across Bangladesh. Peaceful demonstrations by the students restarted on 1 July, while public university teachers declared a strike protesting the new Universal Pension Scheme,  causing universities to close [143]. Demonstrations spread nationwide as the movement became headed by a newly formed Anti-discrimination Students Movement, an umbrella organisation for the student protesters. On July 7, protestors launched the nationwide Bangla Blockade, obstructing traffic and rail in major cities and metropolises including Dhaka, Chittagong, Comilla, Jessore, Rangpur, Rajshahi, and Bogura. While the Appellate Division ordered a four-week status quo regarding the quota on 10 July, protesters continued to demand a solution from the government [119]. Protests turned violent for the first time the next day as the police clashed with the students [120]. On 14 July, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made controversial remarks about the anti-quota protests, escalating the situation and raising the public's anger. On 15 July, the ruling Awami League solidified its stance against the demonstrations, and the protestors met first violent suppression from the Chhatra League leaving several hundred injured. In response to the Chhatra League attacks, student protesters at Rajshahi University vandalized halls, targeting the room of the President of RU Chhatra League and other members associated with the group [121] [122] [123]. The protesters in Dhaka University removed Chhatra League members from 11 different halls and declared a ban on the pro-quota student organization . At other universities across the country, students expelled Chhatra League members from their campuses,  with some members in Chittagong even being thrown from high rooftops by angry protesters during clashes [125] [126]. These actions led to many campuses independently declaring themselves "Chhatra League Free" [127].

The movement resulted in huge damage of various state properties in Bangladesh. According to a report by Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha, at least thirty major state establishments experienced arson and severe damage. The state broadcaster, Bangladesh Television (BTV), was attacked and set on fire on 18 July 2024 [340]. The building suffered extensive damage, with several sections completely burnt. Sheikh Hasina visited the site and expressed deep sorrow over the incident [3] [340]. A major data center in Dhaka was set on fire, causing severe disruptions to internet and telecom services across the country and the loss of 70–80% of the country's bandwidth [341]. Arsons also occurred in the toll stations of Dhaka Elevated Expressway and Mayor Mohammed Hanif Flyover,  and two Dhaka Metro stations, including the Mirpur-10 station [342] [340]. Footage of Sheikh Hasina visiting the station and shedding tears on 25 July was criticised on social media, with users accusing her of failing to react similarly to the loss of life during the protests [205]. According to Bangladesh Police, 235 police infrastructures and 281 vehicles were vandalized and set on fire.

# Mass arrests and detentions

The Bangladesh Police including Detective Branch (DB) and RAB arrested a large number of student protesters and members of opposition political parties. As of July 30, the total count reached over 9600. [u] On 23 July, plainclothes police arrest a non-protester HSC examinee after failing to find his elder brother. On 26 July, plainclothes police officers detained three protest coordinators, namely Nahid Islam, Asif Mahmud and Abu Baker Majumder from Gonoshasthaya Kendra hospital [353]. The three were receiving medical treatment for injuries they received from alleged beatings and torture while in prior police custody. On 27 July, DB detained protest coordinators Sarjis Alam and Hasnat Abdullah [354]. On July 28, plainclothes police detained two more protest coordinators, namely Nusrat Tabassum and Arif Shohel [355]. These detained coordinators but Arif Shohel are the one who issued a statement from the DB office announcing the withdrawal of the protests [356]. However, other coordinators of the Anti-discrimination Students' Movement alleged that these individuals had been coerced by the DB into making the statement. The remaining coordinators announced to continue their protest. After missing for days Arif Shohel and Asif Mahtab Utsha, a former teacher of BRAC University placed six-day remand each [245] [246].

On July 20, Nurul Haq Nur, associated with the 2018 Bangladesh quota reform movement, was arrested by police on charges of involvement in the 18 July arson attack on Setu Bhaban, although there were claims he was not involved. Some observers viewed the arrest as politically motivated. [v] Bangladeshi law mandates that an arrested person must be presented in court within 24 hours; failure to do so is considered an enforced disappearance. According to Nur's wife, he was unaccounted for 40 hours before being brought to court, raising questions about the legality of his detention [361] [362]. She also alleged that Nur was tortured by law enforcers while in remand. On 27 July, Hasanatul Islam Faiaz, a 17-year-old, was presented in a lower court in Dhaka and placed on a seven-day remand.

The charges included murder, concealment of the body, and theft of the officer's motorcycle [367]. Although the case file listed Faiaz's age as 19,  his birth certificate confirmed he was 17, born on 19 April 2007 [368]. On July 28, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court Judge Tahmina Haque canceled the remand order following an appeal, citing the incorrect age in the case file which violates UNCRC [369]. 

# Controversies

## Razakar remarks

On 14 July, during a press conference, Sheikh Hasina responded to a question about the anti-quota protests stating,. Razakars were a Bengali paramilitary force during the Bangladesh Liberation War which collaborated with the Pakistani forces to halt the independence of Bangladesh. In modern-day Bangladesh, the term razakar is used as a pejorative, meaning "traitor" or "collaborator", similar to the usage of "Quisling" in the Western World. Using the term razakar can be highly insulting in Bangladesh [371]. In response to Sheikh Hasina's comment, in the early hours of 15 July, students began using new slogans out of anger such as "তুমি কে, আমি কে? রাজাকার, রাজাকার! কে বলেছে, কে বলেছে? স্বৈরাচার, স্বৈরাচার!" (lit. 'Who are you? Who am I? A Razakar, a Razakar! Who has said it? Who has said it? The Autocrat, the Autocrat!'), [w]   "এক, দুই, তিন, চার, আমরা হলাম রাজাকার" (lit [374]. 'One, two, three, four, we are all Rajakars'),  and "চাইতে গেলাম অধিকার, হয়ে গেলাম রাজাকার!" (lit. 'Sought for rights, got turned into a Razakar!') [x] protesters argued that the Prime Minister's statement indirectly labelled them as "Razakars" and demeaned them for advocating for quota reform,  which led them to adopt the slogan [375] [375]. The Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the ruling party Awami League, threatened that any protester using these slogans would face consequences, as they viewed these actions as something offensive to the spirit of the liberation war and freedom fighters. It also announced plans to take action if the usage of these slogans continued. Social Welfare Minister Dipu Moni stated that the student protesters who call themselves "Razakars" should not have the right to hold the flag of Bangladesh [381] [382]. In light of these events, Sheikh Hasina questioned the education of the protesters [383]. 

## Usage of UN-marked vehicles

Bangladesh Armed Forces used United Nations marked vehicles including APCs during a curfew imposed by the government. Spokesperson of the UN secretary general, Stéphane Dujarric expressed concern over reports of UN-marked vehicles being used during the protests and stated that such vehicles should only be used for official UN peacekeeping or political missions, adding that he had raised the issue to the Bangladeshi government [386]. As of 1 August 2024, the United Nations continues to engage with the Bangladesh Army for its peacekeeping missions, with Bangladesh contributing the third-largest number of troops globally, totalling 5,614 personnel [387] [388]. This engagement persists despite ongoing concerns and reports regarding the country's governance practices. On 24 June, Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud told reporters that some vehicles were "rented to the UN peace mission" and the authorities had forgotten to remove the logos [389]. It is speculated that Bangladesh and its military may face potential sanctions from the Western countries and scrutiny from the International Criminal Court for deploying UN-marked vehicles to target unarmed protesters [390] [391]. 

## Indian involvement

On September 1, 2024, Bonn-based bilingual magazine The Mirror Asia alleged in a report that, following a directive from the Hasina government on July 16 to use force against student protesters, 400 officers trained by Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) were deployed to Dhaka at the request of Sheikh Hasina and India's security advisor Ajit Doval. According to the report, these officers were involved in suppressing the movement using methods similar to those used in Kashmir and returned to Delhi on July 28. The magazine also alleged that R&AW, having been unaware of subsequent developments, was later affected by CIA tactics on August 5. [better source needed] [394] [396]. On August 5, 2024, the day of Sheikh Hasina's resignation, several video clips surfaced online, showing a group of foreign armed personnel departing the country by air from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. On September 25, Chief Prosecutor of the International Crimes Tribunal, Tajul Islam, announced that preliminary investigations indicated the involvement of non-Bengali speaking armed officials in the massacre of protesters [397] [398]. The victims have alleged that these individuals were Hindi speakers. 

# Reactions

Thirty eminent citizens of the country condemned the loss of lives in violent clashes during the protests.

In an interview published on 14 August, nine days after the resignation of Sheikh Hasina, her son and the former IT advisor Sajeeb Wazed expressed that the stand of the fifth Hasina ministry on the quota system was wrong and they should have supported the protesters from the first. 

### Oppose

Muhammad Zafar Iqbal, a renowned Bangladeshi litterateur and former professor at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, remarked that he would not like to visit Dhaka University again, claiming he would see the "Razakars" in the students. This statement sparked immense outrage and controversy among the supporters and the participants in the quota reform movement [404]. Many online bookshops, including Rokomari.com, announced they would no longer sell or promote his literary works, removing his books from their websites. Similarly, students of the university declared him a persona non grata [405].

[y]. Ma Thida, Chair of PEN International's Writers in Prison Committee, condemned the violence and called on the Bangladesh government to protect journalists and ensure their freedom of expression. International Federation for Human Rights and Odhikar urged the government to investigate the law enforcement crackdown and hold officers accountable for unnecessary or disproportionate force. They also called for an immediate, independent investigation into attacks on protesters by BCL members.

The Bangladeshi diaspora in Italy,  Canada,  France,  Qatar,  the United Arab Emirates, the Maldives, the United Kingdom and Malta  protested in solidarity with the protesters in Bangladesh [435] [436] [437] [438] [439]. In the UAE, a demonstration by Bangladeshi labourers also opposed the suppression of protesters, however, several of them were charged with holding protests and violating the UAE's laws against public demonstrations. Following a trial on 21 July, three defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment for "rioting", while 54 others received sentences ranging from 10 to 11 years and were ordered to be deported upon release [441]. Human Rights Watch condemned their arrest, citing the country's restrictive laws and labour conditions as violations of human rights [442] [443]. A Bangladeshi lawyer, Wolora Afrin Rasna was hired by the country’s interim government to secure the release of those imprisoned [444]. Md. Touhid Hossain stated that Muhammad Yunus vowed that he would personally approach senior Emirati authorities to seek the release of those detained, and would also contact the “concerned government”, if necessary. The detainees were later pardoned by UAE president Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on 3 September [445]. In the Maldives, a group of Bangladeshi labourers staged a protest in Southern Huvadhoo Atoll in Thinadhoo on 19 July affirming support for the protests in Bangladesh. However, the Ministry of Homeland Security and Technology ordered their detention and deportation. The Ministry's Spokesperson Fathimath Rifath said that expatriate workers in the Maldives are barred from political involvement in such an act, which amounted to a visa violation [447].
