Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_2024_United_States_presidential_election

This is a list of nationwide public opinion polls that were conducted relating to the general election for the 2024 United States presidential election. Those named in the polls were declared candidates or had received media speculation about their possible candidacy.

# Polling aggregation

The following head-to-head polls feature some of the individuals who officially declared their candidacies. The incumbent president, Joe Biden, won the Democratic primaries. On July 21, 2024, Biden withdrew from the presidential campaign and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, who shortly thereafter became the official nominee of the Democratic Party.. 

# National poll results

National poll results among declared candidates.. 

## Kamala Harris vs. Donald Trump

# Hypothetical polling

## Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

The following nationwide polls feature Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is an independent candidate who suspended his campaign and endorsed Donald Trump.. 

## Undeclared and generic candidates

The following nationwide polls feature at least one individual who is not a candidate for president, nor have they declined the possibility of a future campaign, as well as unnamed "generic" party candidates. Some candidates listed as "Independent" below do have a political party affiliation, but the poll was conducted on the hypothetical that they ran an independent campaign outside their party's nomination process.. 

# Limitations

While national polls give important signals on the views of the electorate, the winner of the election is determined by the United States Electoral College, so the level of support for each candidate in each state is important. This is gauged by state-by-state polling.. Poll results can be affected by methodology, especially in how they predict who will vote in the next election, and re-weighting answers to compensate for slightly non-random samples. One technique, "weighting on recalled vote" is an attempt to compensate for previous underestimates of votes for Donald Trump by rebalancing the sample based on last vote. This can introduce new errors if voters misstate their previous votes. When used for the 2024 presidential election it had produced results closer to the 2020 presidential election than the 2022 mid-term election.
