Marvel_Epic_Collection

The Epic Collection is an ongoing line of color trade paperbacks that republish Marvel comics in a uniform trade dress. Announced in April 2013, their stated intention was to collect entire runs of characters or titles as "big fat collections with the best price we can maintain", in similar manner to the discontinued black-and-white Essential Marvel.
The series is published out of order, though have a completist goal. Marvel's Senior Vice President of Sales David Gabriel said: "When all is said and done, the Epic volumes will fit seamlessly next to one another on readers' bookshelves, presenting a complete and unbroken run of each title."
The original announcement consisted of six titles at the pace of one volume a month, with Gabriel adding: "Marvel's most storied titles — including Amazing Spider-Man, Avengers, Captain America, Fantastic Four, Iron Man and Thor — are going Epic."
The first book, The Enemy Within, Iron Man's 10th numbered volume, was released in September 2013. It sold an estimated 864 copies in the first month, reaching no. 129 in the top-300 graphic novel chart.
Initial sales were steady, with October's release - Thor's 16th volume, War Of The Pantheons - charting at 127 and selling 986 copies in the month of release. November's Amazing Spider-Man  vol. 20: Cosmic Adventures reached no. 103, with 1,010 sales. The Avengers Epic vol. 9: Final Threat in December sold 943, with a chart position of 135.
The first Epic Collection to crack the top-100 was the 10th overall release. Amazing Spider-Man vol. 15: Ghosts Of The Past, in May 2014, sold 1,152 copies, reaching no. 81 (51 for dollar rank).
The series now has more than 50 lines, including licensed books, such Alien, Star Wars, Micronauts and ROM - Spaceknight.
The rate of publication has increased significantly since launch, with 29 Epic Collections released in 2014, the first full year of print. There were 45 in 2019, and 87 in 2024, including reprints. With the escalated rate, two sub-imprints launched in 2023 and 2025 respectively. The Modern Era Epic Collection covers more recent comic runs, and the Ultimate Epic Collection is for the 2000's Ultimate Universe.
DC Comics launched a similar line - DC Finest - in 2024, which it described as "affordably priced, large-size paperback collections" providing "a new line of comprehensive collections of the most in-demand periods, genres, and characters from across DC history".

# Epic Collections

The core books of the Epic Collection largely span Marvel's silver and bronze age of comic books. With a few exceptions, this roughly covers a period from the release of Fantastic Four #1 in 1961  until around 1998 and the launch of Marvel Knights [12]. 

## Aliens

In July 2020, Marvel Comics gained the rights to publish Alien and Predator in the wake of Fox's sale to Disney. Since 2023, the company has been republishing comics originally produced by Dark Horse Comics as part of the Epic Collection. [14]. 

## Amazing Spider-Man

The character's modern era begins with J. Michael Straczynski, who wrote The Amazing Spider-Man for six years from 2001. His first arc, Coming Home, introduced the villain Morlun, and saw Peter Parker's Aunt May discover his alter-ego. Later, the writer attempted to reinvent parts of Spider-Man's origin, with storylines such as Spider-Totem and The Other. He caused controversy with the Sins Past storyline, which involved Gwen Stacy - then navigated the Civil War event, before finishing with One More Day, which saw Peter's marriage to Mary-Jane removed from history. 

## Ant-Man/Giant-Man

The character Hank Pym first appeared in Tales to Astonish #27, from 1962. In the first Epic Collection, his debut as both Ant Man (Tales to Astonish #35) and Giant Man (Tales to Astonish #49) is covered, plus the introduction of Janet van Dyne/Wasp (Tales to Astonish #44)..

The first two volumes include the return of Bucky Barnes as The Winter Soldier, and the death of Captain America following Civil War..

(as it) provided the perfect opportunity for the gravity of the Civil War’s outcome to be felt". 

## Carnage

The villain Carnage has never had an ongoing series, with all Epic Collection releases compiled of miniseries, or appearances in various Spider-Man comics. Large parts of Carnage Volume 1: Born In Blood are also reprinted in Amazing Spider-Man Volume 25: Maximum Carnage.. 

## Conan

From 2022, Marvel lost the license to publish new Conan comics. "The trademark for the name Conan and the names of Robert E. Howard's other principal characters, is maintained by Conan Properties International and licensed to Cabinet Entertainment. This company, or new owners, now wish to publish Conan comic books themselves. And so won't be renewing the Marvel Comics license." [20]. This led to the cancellation of the second King Conan Epic Collection. The license ended up with Titan Publishing. 

## Daredevil

In 1998, Daredevil was cancelled and relaunched, with a new #1 - plus filmmaker Kevin Smith as writer and Joe Quesada as artist. This relaunch "set the tone for the entire Marvel Knights line, directly inspired subsequent depictions of the character in film and television and set the template for how to relaunch a Marvel character." [66]. The rest of the volume was dominated by Brian Michael Bendis' 55 issues, then 33 from Ed Brubaker. Bendis' run starts with Volume 2: Underboss; Brubaker's with Volume 6: The Devil In Cell-Block D.

That event is reprinted at the beginning of Volume 1: Back To School, before the advent of the ongoing Generation X series.. Compared to the rest of the 1990s X-books, Generation X was pitched differently. "This was a book stripped of all the gimmicks that were so common in the '90s. (Writer Scott Lobbell) understood that the X-Men are essentially the comic book equivalent of a soap opera, and that the real focus should always lie upon the interaction between the team members." [25]. 

## Ghost Rider

After a seven-issue run in Marvel Spotlight, the Johnny Blaze version of Ghost Rider got his own ongoing series. The book ran for 11 years, and 81 issues, from 1973 to 1983..

Marvel's own series was popular enough to last until 1983 and issue #125.. Meanwhile, Epic Collection Volume 3: Traitors To The Crown was cancelled due to rights issues.

## New Mutants

Writers Mark Millar and Brian Michael Bendis worked together with artist Adam Kubert for the first six-issue arc, before Warren Ellis took on the series.. Compared to the main universe counterparts, the new series saw: "The more "superheroic" elements of the series done away with, as the Ultimate Fantastic Four book focused more on science fiction and exploration. Doctor Doom was given a less cartoony characterization than his more well-known mainstream counterpart. Other villains such as Mole Man, Annihilus and even Galactus also received massive makeovers." [83]. The series ran for 60 issues.. 

## Ultimate Spider-Man

The first book in Marvel's Ultimate Universe was Ultimate Spider-Man. The title ran from 2000 until 2012, with a younger version of Peter Parker as the main protagonist. The new iteration was a response to "so much backstory that the stories (in the main books) were almost incomprehensible." [84]. Bill Jemas, President of Marvel Enterprises from 2000 to 2004, wrote: “Joe Quesada and I started the Ultimate books because we wanted Marvel to get back in touch with kids. We wanted Marvel's great teen heroes - Spidey and the X-Men - to star in comics for 2001 kids.” [85]. Creator Brian Michael Bendis said: “When I got hired, I literally thought I was going to be writing one of the last — if not the last — Marvel comics.”. The title went on to run for more than 150 issues and launched the character of Miles Morales.. 

## Ultimate X-Men

Launched by writer Mark Millar, Ultimate X-Men saw "the superheroic side of the franchise pushed a bit to the sidelines. Instead, the prejudice mutants faced on a daily basis took center stage.". Millar was followed by superstar writers Brian Michael Bendis, Brian K Vaughan, and Robert Kirkman, and "the Ultimate X-Men comics quickly became the most popular titles at Marvel Comics, even outselling X-Men books in the mainstream continuity." [86]. The series ran for 100 issues.. 

## Ultimates

The Ultimates portrayed a version of The Avengers, outside of the main Marvel continuity that "looked and sounded like a movie in a way that no Marvel story ever had.". Written by Mark Millar, and drawn by Bryan Hitch, the comic blurred the lines of right and wrong, where the heroes "have no idea they are supervillains. They think they’re merely doing what superheroes are supposed to do: defend truth, justice, and the American Way — with an emphasis on the latter."  Millar conceded that point, describing the series as a "pro-status quo book" and "kind of a right-wing book, like Rush Limbaugh doing super comics" [87]. Director of Marvel Studio's 2012 The Avengers movie, Joss Whedon, said: “It’s my feeling that Ultimates brought Marvel into the modern age in a way no other book did.” [84].
