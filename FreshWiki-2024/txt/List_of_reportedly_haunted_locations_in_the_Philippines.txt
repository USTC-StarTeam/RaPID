List_of_reportedly_haunted_locations_in_the_Philippines

There are several reportedly haunted locations in the Philippines. Reports of such haunted locations are part of ghostlore, which is a form of folklore.

# Metro Manila

# Independent cities

## Baguio

The largest city of northern Luzon, the noted tourist destination is said to be highly haunted. There are several haunted locations scattered throughout the city, such as cemeteries, old hotels, and other sites where structures used to stand until the 1990 Luzon earthquake destroyed them, injuring and killing the people inside. The city was also the site of some of the most brutal atrocities committed during the Battle of Baguio. Such haunted locations include the following: [62] [63]. 

# Provinces

## Capiz

This province, located in Panay Island in Western Visayas, has been frequently associated as being the alleged home of the aswang, leading to stereotypes of its inhabitants as such. Recent scientific studies attribute such conceptions to a high prevalence in the province of a rare neurological description called X-linked dystonia parkinsonism, locally known as lubag, which was first discovered there in 1975 and whose symptoms closely resemble recorded descriptions of the aswang [122]. It is estimated that 93% of current cases as of 2022 are located on Panay, and 63% of which are in Capiz [123] [124]. 

## Siquijor

This island-province in Central Visayas has been commonly associated with mystic traditions that the island's growing tourism industry capitalizes on, including tales of sorcery. A ghost ship, known locally as tayog-tayog is also said to appear in the waters of Lazi, although a 2019 investigation by the GMA Network newsmagazine program Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho and the Philippine Coast Guard found that the lights associated with the apparition were caused by regularly scheduled vessels passing through the area [192].
