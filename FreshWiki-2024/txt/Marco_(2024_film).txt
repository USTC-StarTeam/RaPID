# Plot

Victor, a blind person, witnesses the murder of his close friend Wasim. Despite his blindness, Victor identifies the killer by recognising the distinct scent of the killer's perfume and the vehicle. Victor's identification leads the cops to uncover that the killer is Russell Issac, who conspired with Wasim's elder brother Tariq, to carry out the murder. Tragically, Victor gets captured by Russell, who throws him into a vat of hydrofluoric acid, resulting in his agonizing death. Victor's brother George Peter, the patriarch of the Adattu family, is devastated by the loss. Marco, Peter's adopted brother who had been sent to Italy for safety, returns after learning about Victor's death. At Victor's memorial service at their local church, Marco vows to avenge Victor's death, declaring his intent to eliminate everyone involved in the heinous act, including Russell, who is present at the scene. Despite Peter's attempts to dissuade him from taking a path of violence, Marco remains resolute.. Meanwhile, Tony Issac, Russell's father, manipulates the situation to his advantage and strikes a deal with Peter involving gold biscuits and a ransom, all while plotting further treachery. During Peter's return from the deal, Isaac's henchman Dev ambushes him in his car, reveals the conspiracy and fatally stabs him. Peter survives, but is hospitalised, further enraging Marco. Peter informs Marco that Tony and Russell were responsible for Victor's death. As Marco sets out for vengeance, Russell reveals his true nature by severely injuring Marco and using a chainsaw to mutilate the arm of Anwar, Marco's right-hand man. An enraged Marco retaliates, killing Russell's goons with the chainsaw. While preparing to kill Russell, Marco learns that Victor's girlfriend Isha is pregnant with Victor's child and is being held captive by Tony.For her release, Tony demanded Adatt family's entire gold business operations to be written to Tony's company. Marco captures and tortures Dev, who confesses that Isha is with Russell, before dying in an explosion set off by him. Marco storms Issac's factory, battling his goons in a brutal fight to rescue Isha. However, Tony deceives Marco, revealing that Isha is locked in the trunk of Russell's car. Marco and Anwar track Tony to his guesthouse, where Tony attempts to bargain for his life. After learning that Tony is bisexual, Marco, in retaliation for Anwar's fate, cuts off Tony's hand and sends it to Russell, disguised as a suitcase containing company documents. In a final trap, Marco rigs Tony's chair with a detonator, causing the bomb to trigger just as Tony is hanged. As Tony is hanged in the air, the bomb detonates, leading to his suffering. Russell stands helpless outside the warehouse and is unable to do anything, but watch as Tony suffers through his final moments. Peter kills Tariq by hanging him.. Desperate for revenge, Russell seeks help from his adopted brother Cyrus, a ruthless butcher. They launch an attack on the Adattu household, during Isha's labour, and begin slaughtering the family. Despite Peter's valiant efforts, Cyrus and Russell kill all the family members, including the children, Marco's fiancée Maria and Isha, brutally killing her and abducting her newborn child. Marco, gravely injured and helpless, is left to mourn his family's death. Peter urges Marco to avenge not only Victor, but the entire family. Marco adopts a striking and fearsome appearance and confronts Cyrus and Russell at their factory. Marco fights through their henchmen in a bloody showdown, where he kills Russell by stabbing him and ripping out his heart. In a climatic encounter with Cyrus, who holds the newborn child over a vat of acid, Marco decapitates him and rescues the child before pushing him into the acid.. Marco completes his path of vengeance and leaves the factory with the child, while paying the ultimate price in the suffering and loss of his family. In the aftermath, Marco spends time with Victor's son until a platoon of cars arrive and take the child away as the screen cuts to black..
