# Life and career

## Early life

Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania. She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor . Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive [2] [3]. Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor [4]. Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer,  whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music that shaped her career [6]. Swift is of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry [4]. Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania that her father had purchased from one of his clients,  and she spent her summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop [10]. She is Christian  and attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St [11] [12]. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School. When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School [13] [14]. As a child, she performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions  and traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons [15] [16] [17]. Her early love for country music was influenced by Shania Twain, Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,  and she spent weekends performing at local festivals and events [18] [14]. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she became determined to pursue a country music career in Nashville, Tennessee [19]. At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting [22]. She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of Ronnie Cremer, a computer repairman and local musician who also assisted Swift with writing an original song [23]. In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow [24]. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD. After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother [25]. To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee [26] [27]. Swift attended Hendersonville High School  before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling [28] [29] [30]. She graduated one year early. 

## 2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album

In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers   and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose [32] [33]. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school [34]. Rose called the sessions "some of the easiest I've ever done [35]. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks." At 14, Swift became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing. She left RCA Records due to the label's lack of care and them "cut [ting] other people's stuff" [36]. She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists   and recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time [27]. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through." [37]. At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004. She was one of Big Machine's first signings,  and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000 [39] [27]. She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman [40] [41] [42]. Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia . Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade [43]. Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album [45]. Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, "Tim McGraw", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,  as a replacement for Eric Church [47] [48]. Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music [49]. Following "Tim McGraw", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn", and "Should've Said No". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" reaching number one. "Our Song" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single,  and "Teardrops on My Guitar" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts [50]. Swift released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008 [51] [53]. She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,  Brad Paisley,  and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill [54] [55] [56] [57]. Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title. She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,  the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,  and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor [59] [60] [61]. She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards [62]. In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again  and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas [63] [64].

It was the bestselling album of 2009 in the US [68]. Its lead single, "Love Story", was her first number one in Australia and the first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart,   and its third single, "You Belong with Me", was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart [69] [70] [136].

## 2014–2018: 1989 and Reputation

In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City, which she credited as a creative influence on her fifth studio album, 1989. [note 1] She described 1989 as her first "official pop album" and produced it with Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.

After publishing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal stressing the importance of albums as a creative medium for artists,  in November 2014, Swift removed her catalog from ad-supported, free music streaming platforms such as Spotify [137]. In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during its free three-month trial period and threatened to withdraw her music from the platform,  which prompted Apple Inc [138] [139]. to announce that it would pay artists during the free trial period.

In April 2016, Kanye West released the single "Famous", in which he references Swift in the line, "I made that bitch famous." Swift criticized West and said she never consented to the lyric, but West claimed that he had received her approval and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the song amicably over the phone [153]. The controversy made Swift a subject of an online "cancel" movement. In late 2016, after briefly dating Tom Hiddleston, Swift began a six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn and retreated herself from the public spotlight [154]. In August 2017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event.

Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign [180]. In November 2020, Swift began re-recording her back catalog, which enabled her to own the new masters and the licensing of her songs for commercial use, substituting for the Big Machine-owned masters [180]. In February 2020, Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired.

After the pandemic, Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity. From 2023 onward, Swift found ubiquitous success, albeit more dominant than before, with the successes of the re-recordings, the Eras Tour, its concert film, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, significantly increasing her net worth; Music Business Worldwide remarked this as a "new stratosphere of global career success" for Swift [238]. In 2023, she began dating the American football player Travis Kelce,  and in 2024, won Artist of the Year at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards [239] [240] [241]. Swift was Spotify's most streamed artist once again in 2024 [242]. In January 2024, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform. In July, Swift and Kelce received death threats from a stalker in Gelsenkirchen, Germany,  and three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport, England, leading to civil unrest in the UK [245] [246]. In August, all three of the Eras Tour concerts in Vienna were canceled following the arrest of two suspects for allegedly planning an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack in the city [247]. The plan was uncovered by US intelligence and was thwarted by Austrian police forces. 

# Artistry

## Musical styles

Swift has ventured into diverse genres throughout her career, including pop, [b] country, [c] folk, [d] rock, [e] and alternative music. [f] Her early musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,  and Keith Urban's country crossover sounds incorporating rock, pop, and blues [265]. She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red . The albums feature country signifiers such as banjo, six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, in addition to pop melodies and rock influences;   Speak Now draws on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock [268] [269]. Critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's narrative songwriting rather than musical direction   and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots [95] [270]. After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna. 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines [276]. Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums;  Reputation consists of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences;   and Lover features eclectic elements from country, pop-punk, and folk rock [278] [158] [279]. When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity,  but others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism [281]. Her 2020 alternative albums Folklore and Evermore explore indie styles of rock and folk, and both incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads. The latter experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments [264] [285]. Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter [287]. Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both incorporate a minimalist, subdued synth-pop sound, making use of analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns [285]. With continuous musical reinventions,  Swift was described by Time and the BBC as a musical "chameleon" . Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a "bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop" [291]. Clash wrote that she has the versatility to "no longer  [...] be defined by any genre or sound label" [293]. According to Ann Powers, Swift's sound is genre-agnostic, blending and "reconfiguring" elements of country, R&B, indie pop, and hip hop [294]. 

## Voice

Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range  and a generally soft and breathy timbre that Rolling Stone deemed versatile [301]. Reviews of Swift's early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers [302] [303]. Despite the criticism, most reviewers appreciated that Swift refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized "intimacy over power and nuance" to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience —a style that has been described as conversational [304] [305]. According to Powers, Swift's defining vocal feature was her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow" [306] [307]. On Red and 1989, Swift's vocals are electronically processed to accompany the pop production. Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody [309] [306]. She uses her lower register vocals extensively in "Cardigan"  and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as "breathy and bright" and the lower register as "full and dark" [310] [295]. Reviews in The New York Times, Variety and The Atlantic were more appreciative of Swift's vocals in her later albums. She ranked 102nd on Rolling Stone's 2023 list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time: "A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights officially settled the argument."  Laura Snapes of The Guardian said that Swift's "vocal directness" enables her to express wide-ranging feelings, highlighting some trademarks such as "yo-yoing vocal yelp" and "climactic, processed cri de coeur" [269] [313] [314] [303]. Amanda Petrusich praised how the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals accentuate her lyrics [315]. 

## Songwriting

Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations. She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them [317] [318]. Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton;   1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette;  Joni Mitchell;  and Fall Out Boy [319] [19] [104] [320] [321]. She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs [322]. Her literary influences include the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F [28] [323]. Scott Fitzgerald,  and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson;  the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift [324] [325]. In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: "I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across". Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life [28]. Her "diaristic" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody [327] [29]. On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes [328] [329]. She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,  and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989 [95] [330] [331]. Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,  and Lover detailed her realization of the "full spectrum of love" [332]. Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,   alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism [333] [334] [335]. She often references or draws inspiration from historical events and figures [318] [336]. Neil McCormick, the chief music critic of The Daily Telegraph, opined that Swift is a "significant vehicle for expressing the inner lives and day-to-day concerns of women of her generation  [and younger]" [337]. Swift's confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,    who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music,    although some perceived her as a fragile, juvenile artist, a label she has consistently challenged [339] [28] [340] [341] [342] [343]. Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture" [339]. NPR dubbed Swift "a master of the vernacular in her lyrics",  remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because "the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures" [344] [306] [158]. Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary" [306]. Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist [28]. Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs [345] [346] [347]. On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives. She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry [349]. Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success [328]. According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with "precision and devastation" on Evermore [349]. Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from "teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult" [350]. Swift divides her writing into three types: "quill lyrics", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; "fountain pen lyrics", based on modern and vivid storylines; and "glitter gel pen lyrics", which are lively and frivolous. Fans noticed that the fifth track of every Swift album was the most emotionally vulnerable of the album [352]. Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that "no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today" [353]. The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,  and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022 [354] [355]. Swift has also published two original poems: "Why She Disappeared" and "If You're Anything Like Me" [203]. Critics have analyzed the distinctive qualities and thematic depth in Swift's songwriting. Critic Kitty Empire opined in 2024 that Swift is "a profoundly old-fashioned artist", whose songs "tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings. Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,   earning her the title "Queen of Bridges" from Time [357] [358] [351]. Mojo dubbed her "a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor" [359]. Academics have variably described her as a poet laureate,  philosopher,  and bard [360] [361] [362]. 

## Performances

Swift commands large audiences on stage,    captivating them through emotional storytelling and vocal delivery rather than relying on elaborate dance choreography [363] [364] [365]. According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses "a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting", irrespective of whether she is "plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers" [366]. In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a "preternaturally skilled" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding "she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen."  In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her "seemingly endless stamina" on the Eras Tour,  and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship "unparalleled" [367] [368]. Swift's concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,  and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007 [370]. Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;  acoustic guitar; piano;  and sometimes twelve-string guitar,   six-string banjo,  or ukulele [371] [372] [373] [374] [375] [376]. Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection [377]. Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains "integral to her singer-songwriter origins" [378]. Chris Willman of Variety called Swift "pop's most approachable superstar",  and the 21st century's most popular performer [379] [373] [380]. 

## Video and film

Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process. She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time, she has become more involved with writing and directing [382]. She developed the concept and treatment for "Mean" in 2011  and co-directed the music video for "Mine" with Roman White the year before [383]. In an interview, White said that Swift "was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe [384]. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes." [385]. From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement. She worked with American Express for the "Blank Space" music video (which Kahn directed) and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015 [386]. Swift produced the music video for "Bad Blood" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016 [387]. Her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media, starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour. She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles "Me!" with Dave Meyers, and "You Need to Calm Down" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and "Lover" with Drew Kirsch,  but first ventured into sole direction with the video for "The Man" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction) [389] [390]. After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,  which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director [391] [203]. Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences [392].

# Cultural status

Swift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture, and the economy. She dominates cultural conversations,   leading some publications to describe her as a cultural "vitality" or zeitgeist [452] [453] [455]. Her music, life, and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture [456] [457] [362]. Initially a teen idol,  she has been referred to as a pop icon;   publications describe her enormous popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century [458] [278] [459]. In 2013, New York magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the "world's biggest pop star" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns [460] [461]. Rosen added that Swift "falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends", leaving her contemporaries "vying for second place". Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes [293]. Swift's fans are known as Swifties. Billboard noted that only a few artists have achieved her level of chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support [228]. Swift's million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s [463]. Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an "economic genius" [464] [465]. Although labeled by the media in her early career as "America's Sweetheart" for her girl next door persona,   Swift has been called by detractors "calculated" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West [467] [468]. Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and "slut-shaming",   as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation [469] [470] [471] [472].

In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights [476] [477]. In December 2023, Swift's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, alleging stalking and safety risks; media outlets have reported that the information posted by Sweeney is a synthesis of publicly available data [478]. In February 2024, it was reported that Swift had sold one of her two private jets [480] [481]. 

## Legacy

Swift helped shape the modern country music scene,  having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,   pioneered the use of the internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,   and introduced the genre to a younger generation [484] [293] [484] [27] [47]. Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;  her guitar performances contributed to the "Taylor Swift factor": a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed [485] [293] [486]. According to Pitchfork, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,  and Billboard notes her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music [489]. Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same [490]. Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift [174]. She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album "eras" [325] [491].

Various sources deem Swift's music a paradigm representing the millennial generation;  Vox and The Daily Telegraph likened her to Bruce Springsteen,   and The Times named her "the Bob Dylan of our age" [498] [499] [500] [338]. Swift earned the title Woman of the Decade (2010s) from Billboard,  Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,  and Global Icon at the Brit Awards for her impact [501] [502] [503]. Senior artists such as Madonna,  Stevie Nicks,  Jon Bon Jovi,  Dolly Parton,  and Elton John have praised her musicianship [410] [504] [505] [506] [507]. Carole King regards Swift as her "professional granddaughter" and thanked Swift for "carrying the torch forward" [508]. Springsteen called her a "tremendous" writer,  while Elvis Costello compared Swift's songwriting to that of Bob Dylan,  and Billy Joel considered Swift the Beatles' successor [509] [510] [511]. Britney Spears labeled Swift "the most iconic pop woman of our generation" [512].

Swift has endorsed many brands and businesses, having launched clothing lines with L.E.I. and Stella McCartney,   designed American Greetings cards and Jakks Pacific dolls,   released a number of fragrances with Elizabeth Arden,  and signed multi-year deals with AT&T and Capital One [526] [527] [528] [529] [530]. She was a spokesperson for the National Hockey League's Nashville Predators and Sony Cyber-shot digital cameras,   and became the global ambassador for New York City in 2014 and Record Store Day in 2022 [531] [532] [533] [534].

Specifically, she criticized the US Supreme Court's decision to end federal abortion rights in 2022 [538]. Swift also advocates for LGBT rights,  and has called for the passing of the Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity [539] [540].
