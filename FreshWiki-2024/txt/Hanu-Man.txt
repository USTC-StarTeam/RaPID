Near the sea lies Anjanadri, a dystopian village under the tyranny of its polygar, Gajapathi. Hanumanthu, a petty thief from Anjanadri, harbors feelings for Meenakshi, the granddaughter of the local school headmaster. Meenakshi opposes Gajapathi's rule and encourages the villagers to revolt.. Gajapathi, feeling threatened, orchestrates a fake bandit attack on Meenakshi to eliminate her.

The next day, he is found unconscious on the shore, alarming his elder sister Anjamma and friend Kasi. However, Hanumanthu's wounds heal instantly, and he gains superhuman strength from the gem when exposed to sunlight, though it loses power without it.. Hanumanthu tries to prove to Meenakshi that he is her savior, leading to comical situations, and while she remains skeptical, Kasi realizes his newfound powers. When Meenakshi confronts Gajapathi over his injustice, Gajapathi challenges her to a wrestling match. Hanumanthu steps in, defeats Gajapathi using the gem, and is declared the new Polygar. However, he proposes abolishing the Polygar system and establishing democracy, which impresses Meenakshi.. Michael and Siri arrive in Anjanadri under the guise of CSR, with Michael secretly seeking to acquire Hanumanthu's powers.

Later, Hanumanthu, realizing his sister Anjamma's sacrifices for him, becomes more responsible and arranges her wedding.. Sensing a threat to Meenakshi, Hanumanthu is suddenly kidnapped by Siri, who demands the source of his powers while Michael monitors them remotely.

Hanumanthu also warns Gajapathi to stay away from Meenakshi, urging him to be a benevolent leader in the upcoming elections.. Hanumanthu infiltrates Michael's camp to uncover his true intentions. Michael, revealing his plan to destroy Anjanadri and seize the gem, almost kills Siri by setting fire to their tent and admitting that he had killed his own parents similarly. The elderly sage, disguised as Hanumanthu, defeats the goons and returns the gem to Hanumanthu.. On Anjamma's wedding day, Michael interrupts, accusing Hanumanthu of stealing his ancestral gem. Hanumanthu gives Michael a fake gem, which injures Michael and exposes his lies. When Michael's men attack, Hanumanthu and Anjamma defend themselves, but Anjamma dies in the fight. Grieving, Hanumanthu discards the gem, believing it failed him.. Michael then releases a toxic smoke into the village, freezing the inhabitants.

# Production

## Development

The producer Niranjan Reddy approached director Prasanth Varma to direct a film for his banner after watching Zombie Reddy (2021). After successfully directing Zombie Reddy, Varma announced his fourth film on 29 May 2021, coinciding with his birthday [12]. It was announced that the film will be the first superhero film in Telugu cinema [13] [14]. In an interview with Deccan Chronicle he said, "the film is inspired by the Hindu God Hanuman", adding "As for the title of the film, Prasanth says he chose it because it was a dedication to many who, when they think of any superpower or a superhero in Hinduism, we remember Hanuman [15] [16]. In the film, the name of the protagonist is Hanu-Man", regarding the title of the film. The film was funded by the American NRI film distributor, Kandagatla Niranjan Reddy, under Primeshow Entertainment. It was made on a shoe-string budget of ₹20 crores [18]. During the teaser launch event held in Hyderabad in November 2022, Varma revealed that the production budget increased six times from the initial valuation [19]. Hanu-Man is the first installment of the Prasanth Varma Cinematic Universe (PVCU) [20]. 

## Pre-production

The story of Hanu-Man came from Varma and was then developed by his team at Scriptsville, a writing team he co-founded with his sister, Sneha Sameera. In an interview, Varma said that his education in a gurukul helped him with the film's research [22]. Varma also sought S [23]. S. Rajamouli's advice while making the film. Anudeep Dev, GowraHari, and Krishna Saurabh were hired to compose the music for the film. GowraHari composed the background score for the film [25]. Sai Babu Tallari was hired for the editing, reuniting with Varma after Zombie Reddy [26]. The other technicians includes cinematographer Dasaradhi Sivendra,  production designer Nagendra Tangala,  action choreographers Nandu and Prudhvi,   costume designer Lanka Santhoshi [27] [28] [29] [30] [31]. Prior to starting the first shooting schedule, the team had constructed a studio in a leased land at Vattinagulapally located in Telangana, for filming green screen shots. Prior to the start of film production, Teja Sajja had attended a special workshop, in order to train physically and intensively for his role in the film [22]. [citation needed]. 

## Casting

Teja Sajja played the titular character Hanumanthu, a superhero, and sported long hair and bearded look. His look was finalised after trying out 25 different looks [33]. [citation needed] This marked Tejja's third collaboration with Varma after their Zombie Reddy and Adbhutham (2021). About casting Teja Sajja as lead actor, Varma said "when I was casting for this film, I wanted to cast an actor who could give his 100 per cent and be fully committed to this film [34]. He had to maintain a particular look and also suit the part. So, I think Teja fits the bill. He is the most lovable underdog and an amazing actor who can give me enough time to make this film". He had to learn scuba diving for the film [35]. Amritha Aiyer was cast as the film's lead actress, and her character name Meenakshi was revealed in December 2021 [36]. Varma said he selected Amritha Aiyer after watching "Neeli Neeli Aakasam" song [37]. Varalaxmi Sarathkumar was roped in a pivotal role, and her inclusion was confirmed on 4 March 2022, on the eve of her birthday [38]. Tamil actor Vinay Rai was announced as the film's antagonist in June 2022 [39]. Varma revealed that Rai's suit was difficult to wear and lost two kilograms while shooting [40]. [citation needed]. The film also features Vennela Kishore, Satya, Getup Srinu, Raj Deepak Shetty, Koushik Mahata and Bhanu Prakash in pivotal roles. Rishab Shetty was approached to play the role of Vibhishana,  but declined the role, citing commitments to Kantara, thus went to Samuthirakani [41]. Ravi Teja gave his voice to the monkey character Koti [42]. The name of the fictional village was announced as Anjanadri [43]. 

## Design

Nagendra Tangala served as the production designer for Hanu-Man. The team leased an agricultural land in Vattinagulapally near Hyderabad and designed the sets of Anjanadri there, which took about 150 to 200 days [45]. "When director Prashanth told this story, we definitely wanted to create a new world for Anjanadri [46]. We thought that it should be designed naturally to be close to fantasy and reality. Surrounded by green environment, high hills, and the river on the other side, we were fixed to build it like a beautiful village among Panchabhutas", Nagendra on constructing Anjanadri village. The bank fight sequence was also set there [46]. "Challenge for me was to design the Rudramani which is formed from Hanuman's blood drop [46]. We made more than a hundred manis in various shapes to make it natural and believable to everyone. In the end, Hanuman's blood drop was placed as Rama's name and surrounded by a powerful protective shield. It worked out well. In fact, when this mani was made, the film was 50 percent shot," Nagendra on creating Rudramani. The team had constructed a set of double-bedroom flats built by the government near Kollur, for filming the bank robbery scene. The team rebuilt the entire Maharshi set on the floor in one day at Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad for filming the film's climax scenes [47]. Nagendra revealed that the team designed the big Hanuman statue in Anjanadri through graphics, inspired by the seven hills of Tirumala [47].

Around 60% of filming was completed by December 2021 [51]. [citation needed]. The team constructed a temporary studio called Hanuman Studio at Vattinagulapally, where most of the green screen shots portions were filmed. For wide angle visuals, the team moved to Paderu and Maredumilli in Andhra Pradesh. The underwater sequence was filmed in December 2022 in Mumbai [22].

Extensive work on the visual effects took place for more than a year during the post-production process [58]. VFX of the film was done by Udaikrishna Pandamaneti [59]. The picturization of "Anjandri Theme Song" was storyboarded in 2D, but inspired by the visual effects of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, team decided to give it a 3D feel and roped in Eitri Studio [60]. Animation studios Dhruv, ECS, Visikefi as well as freelance technicians across the country worked for the film. Anjanadri establishment shot, a technically challenging scene lasting over two minutes [61]. To achieve this, extensive research and the utilisation of Hollywood software, coupled with an intelligent pipeline, were employed. Paderu Girula has been linked to the graphics in this film. Udaykrishna said that along with his friend, photographer from Chodavaram, he traveled around Paderu for a week. More than three thousand photos and videos were taken and they were used in the film to suit the graphics. Varma had the plan to sign Kannada actor Yash to play Hanuman and include a live-action portrayal [63]. But Udaikrishna convinced him to design a 3D model, assuring Varma that it would not appear cartoonish. It took nearly seven months for the visual effects shots of Hanuman [61]. Udaikrishna said that "photorealistic Hanuman in the all-important climax song is the film's USP" [55]. The final edit had around 1600 visual effects shots, which constituted approximately 30% of the film [61].

# Themes and influences

Hanu-Man is blend of sci-fi, fantasy and mythology. The film, featuring Teja Sajja as the titular character, revolves around Hanumanthu, a small-time thief, and his journey to save his village and the world after discovering a totem that enhances his abilities [72]. Varma said he was taught itihas as a subject in school, and was very passionate about those stories, and those characters inspired him to make the film [73]. As he felt he is not mature enough or big enough director to make films on itihas, he started from doing a superhero film, where a normal boy gets powers of Hanuman, from there on down, maybe mature to direct those big stories. In an interview, he said "I always wanted to do a superhero film [74]. In fact, I wanted to become a superhero! Since I couldn't do that I thought, let me make a film. I didn't want it to be a Marvel or DC-like superhero film but something indigenous and culturally rooted. The first thought that came to mind was Hanuman ji and I wrote the story. Then I got multiple ideas for various superheroes based on our itihaas and it took off from there." [75]. The film borrows elements from Indian mythology, mostly from the Ramayana and the depictions of Hanuman and his exploits in the various oral and written traditions of Hinduism. DNA India wrote "despite the vociferous proclamations of Jai Shri Ram and songs borrowing lyrics from popular bhajans, HanuMan is not a religious film. It is a superhero film that uses mythology and religious elements, blending them with science and spirituality quite neatly."  Varma said he didn't view this film as a mythological tale and it would have presented him many new challenges [76]. The film is set in a modern-day world blended with a key incident from Hanuman's life. Varma says, "the film's idea was born out of a small story related to Hanuman and it will leave audience thoroughly satisfied with the visualisation of the character, like how we have imagined him since childhood. We worked on the character sketches alone for a year". "I have always been fascinated by the stories from our mythology and culture [77]. When I was researching 'HanuMan', I found more characters in our mythology that we have not really explored. The audiences are also not aware of them. So I thought, it'd be interesting if I could create new characters and narrate their greatness at the same time", Varma told PTI following the film's release. Varma revealed that he narrated the story to lyricist Siva Shakthi Datta for his guidance [78]. India Today's Sana Farzeen notes, "Hanumanth attains superpowers, giving him the way to win his ladylove's heart. However, the catch is, just like Koi... Mil Gaya's Jaadu, the power or Hanuman's 'mani' can help him only when the sun is up." She also notes "fictional world of Anjanadri, a land that looks like a beta version of Mahishmati (Baahubali). A huge statue of Hanuman adorns the location as a prelude to all that is set to follow."  About choosing the fictional village Anjanadri, Varma said "If Gotham is based on New York City, Anjanadri, which is also the name of Hanumanthudu's birthplace, is an island in Andhra Pradesh, somewhat like Yanam." He also found inspiration from Krrish (2006) and Minnal Murali (2021) [80]. The film has ample references to pop culture elements, Spider-Man, Superman and Batman. The film pays tribute to Telugu superstars such as Prabhas, Mahesh Babu, Pawan Kalyan, Allu Arjun, and Nandamuri Balakrishna [76] [80]. The film also has scenes referring Baahubali (2015), Athadu (2005), Arya (2004) and Pushpa: The Rise (2021) [82].
