Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in the United States on November 7, 2028, to elect a president and vice president for a term of four years. The winners of the election are expected to be inaugurated on January 20, 2029.
After winning the 2016 and 2024 presidential elections, President Donald Trump is ineligible for a third term, due to the provisions of the Twenty-second Amendment.

Potential contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination include former vice president Kamala Harris, former secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, governors Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gavin Newsom of California, JB Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Tim Walz of Minnesota, senators Ruben Gallego of Arizona, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, former governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina, former mayor Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, as well as former representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota.
Potential contenders for the Republican presidential nomination include Vice President JD Vance, governors Ron DeSantis of Florida and Brian Kemp of Georgia and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and former governor Doug Burgum of North Dakota.

# Background

The Republican Party, represented by Donald Trump and JD Vance, returned to power in the United States in January 2025 following the 2024 election. Trump, who was elected president in 2016 but lost a re-election bid in 2020 to Joe Biden, defeated vice president Kamala Harris, who began her campaign following president Joe Biden's exit from the 2024 election. Trump's victory was credited to a surge in inflation, a migrant crisis at the US–Mexico border,  and a global anti-incumbent backlash [2]. Republicans secured control of the Senate and retained a House majority [3] [4]. 

# Electoral system

The president and vice president of the United States are elected through the Electoral College, a group of 538 presidential electors who convene to vote for the president and vice president. The number of electors in the Electoral College is determined through the total number of senators and representatives with an additional three representatives for Washington, D.C.. Electors cast votes for the president and vice president; the winner is elected through a majority of 270 votes. If the election ends in a tie, a contingent election occurs, in which the House of Representatives votes on the president and the Senate votes on the vice president. Forty-eight states use a winner-take-all system in which states award all of their electors to the winner of the popular vote. In Maine and Nebraska, two votes are allocated to the winner of the popular vote, while each of the individual congressional districts have one vote. Electoral votes are certified by state electors in December and by Congress on January 6. Presidential candidates are selected in a presidential primary, conducted through primary elections or caucuses. The results of primary elections, ran by state governments, and caucuses, ran by state parties, bind convention delegates to candidates. The Democratic Party mandates a proportional allocation if a candidate receives at least fifteen percent in a given congressional district, while the Republican Party gives state parties the authority to allocate all of the delegates to a candidate within the "proportionality window", set by the first two weeks of March. After the window, state parties may set individual rules. A brokered convention occurs when a candidate does not receive a majority of votes on the first round of voting,  or when a candidate withdraws [7] [8]. Article Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years of age, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. The Twenty-second Amendment forbids any person from being elected president more than twice [10]. Trump is ineligible to seek a third term [11] [12]. 

## Electoral map

Most U.S. states are not highly competitive in presidential elections, often voting consistently for the same party due to longstanding demographic differences. In the Electoral College, this results in major-party candidates primarily focusing their campaigns on swing states, which can swing between parties from election to election. These states are critical for a presidential candidate's path to victory. For 2028, the expected swing states likely include the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, as well as the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina, [citation needed] all of which were narrowly won by Trump in 2024. The Minnesota Star Tribune also reported that the close margin in Minnesota would make it specifically a very likely swing state [14] [15] [16]. Red states, also known as the red wall or red sea, are states that consistently vote Republican at the national level. The red wall has rarely been broken, as these states almost never swing. The last significant breach of the red wall occurred in the 1992 United States presidential election. States formerly considered swing states, such as Florida, Iowa, and Ohio, voted for Trump in all three of his elections, with increasing margins in each election (and have become reliably red in other state and federal elections) which suggests that they are no longer swing states. Blue states are states that consistently vote Democratic at the national level [18] [19] [20]. The blue states in 2024 include what is sometimes called the blue wall,  as well as Colorado, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Virginia, former swing states that have become reliably blue since 2008 even in Republican national victories [21]. Due to its recent record of voting Democratic even during Republican national wins, Nebraska's 2nd congressional district is also sometimes considered blue [22]. 

# Republican Party

## Potential candidates

### Doug Burgum

Doug Burgum served as the governor of North Dakota from 2016 to 2024 and is Trump's pick for Secretary of the Interior. He has been described as a potential candidate in 2028 by Republican insider Pat Finken stating that his naming as Secretary was likely a springboard for a 2028 campaign especially due to his meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. During Burgum's 2024 campaign one of the key criticisms he received from the Republican party is that he should instead be focusing on the 2028 election, as he stood no feasible chance against Trump due to his low polling numbers [25]. U.S [26]. bookmakers have given Burgum the same odds to win the 2028 election as Tim Walz, Gretchen Whitmer, and Elon Musk. [b] [27]. 

### Ted Cruz

Ted Cruz has served as a U.S. senator from Texas since 2013. The runner-up to Donald Trump in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Cruz has said that he expects to seek the presidency again at some point in the future. In May 2024, he told Fox News Digital that he would decide on launching a 2028 bid 'down the road' . In October 2024, the Houston Chronicle described Cruz as being on a 'short list of Republicans rumored for a presidential run in 2028', but added that his hopes hinged on proving that he could attract voters outside of 'hard-line conservatives' [29]. The Texas Tribune posited following Cruz's reelection victory in November 2024 that he had kept his national ambitions alive, reporting that Brendan Steinhauser, a Texas GOP operative independent of Cruz's Senate campaign, argued that Cruz's comfortable win 'keeps him in the conversation nationally', adding that Cruz could springboard his coalition in Texas into a formidable presidential campaign [30]. 

### Ron DeSantis

Ron DeSantis has served as the governor of Florida since 2019 and previously ran for the Republican nomination in 2024.. He has been considered a possible candidate by Politico  and Florida Politics [32]. 

### Brian Kemp

Brian Kemp has served as the governor of Georgia since 2019. Kemp opposed President Trump's claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, but was ultimately endorsed by Trump in Kemp's successful 2022 re-election campaign.

### JD Vance

JD Vance has served as the vice president of the United States since 2025. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Ohio from 2023 to 2025.

U.S. News reports that Buttigieg is seen as the party's top 'communicator', appearing on conservative television defending President Biden's policies. This report also hinted that Buttigieg might also run for governor of Michigan in 2026 to replace term-limited governor Gretchen Whitmer. After Buttigieg's radio talk show appearances in New Hampshire and Cleveland to address infrastructure plans for the future, there has been speculation that Buttigieg might be making early campaign stops for the governor race in Michigan as well as the presidential election [55].
