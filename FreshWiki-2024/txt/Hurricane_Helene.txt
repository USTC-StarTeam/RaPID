Hurricane_Helene

Hurricane Helene (  heh-LEEN) was a devastating tropical cyclone that caused widespread catastrophic damage and numerous fatalities across the Southeastern United States in late September 2024. It was the strongest hurricane on record to strike the Big Bend region of Florida, the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Maria in 2017, and the deadliest to strike the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005.
The eighth named storm, fifth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, Helene began forming on September 22 as a broad low-pressure system in the western Caribbean Sea. By September 24, the disturbance had consolidated enough to become a tropical storm as it approached the Yucatán Peninsula, receiving the name Helene from the National Hurricane Center. Weather conditions led to the cyclone's intensification, and it became a hurricane early on September 25. More pronounced and rapid intensification ensued as Helene traversed the Gulf of Mexico the following day, reaching Category 4 intensity on the evening of September 26. Late on September 26, Helene made landfall at peak intensity in the Big Bend region of Florida, near the city of Perry, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). Helene weakened as it moved quickly inland before degenerating to a post-tropical cyclone over Tennessee on September 27. The storm then stalled over the state before dissipating on September 29.
In advance of Helene's landfall, states of emergency were declared in Florida and Georgia due to the significant impacts expected, including very high storm surge along the coast and hurricane-force gusts as far inland as Atlanta. Hurricane warnings also extended further inland due to Helene's fast motion. The storm caused catastrophic rainfall-triggered flooding, particularly in western North Carolina, East Tennessee, and southwestern Virginia, and spawned numerous tornadoes. Helene also inundated Tampa Bay, breaking storm surge records throughout the area. As of January 7, 2025, at least 219 deaths and $78.7 billion in damage.

# Meteorological history

On September 17, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) highlighted the potential for tropical cyclogenesis in the western Caribbean Sea. Conditions conducive for development of a tropical cyclone resulted from the interaction of the Central American gyre—a broad monsoon low pressure system—and the Madden–Julian Oscillation, which reinforced the large-scale cyclonic flow extending from the eastern Pacific Ocean to the western Caribbean Sea [6]. Several days later, on September 22, a broad low-pressure area developed within the western Caribbean [7]. As the system traversed an environment conducive for tropical cyclone development,  showers and thunderstorms associated with the disturbance gradually consolidated [4] [8]. Due to the system's imminent threat to land, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine on September 23 [9]. The next day, Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters aircraft found that the system was producing flight-level winds of 52 mph (84 km/h) and had developed a better-defined center; the NHC accordingly upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Helene at 15:00 UTC [10]. The system continued strengthening, with NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters finding that Helene's maximum winds had increased to 80 mph (130 km/h) [11]. As a result, NHC upgraded the system to a hurricane by 15:00 UTC on September 25, as it entered the Gulf of Mexico while turning north. An upper-level trough to its west and a ridge of high pressure located off the Southeastern United States both served to steer the cyclone towards the U.S. Gulf Coast. Helene was a very large system,  with the NHC noting in multiple forecast discussions that the forecast storm radii were "at the 90th percentile of hurricane size at similar latitudes" [12] [13]. After remaining steady in intensity for a while due to its broad size and some entrainment of drier air to its west, Helene recovered quickly and began its rapid intensification early on the morning of September 26 – aided by low mid-level wind shear, high relative humidity values and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) exceeding 30 °C (86 °F) near the Loop Current — as an increasingly defined eye developed, reaching Category 2 intensity at 12:00 UTC. Quickly strengthening, by 18:25 UTC Helene was found to have become a major hurricane by Hurricane Hunters,  and four hours later, a Category 4 hurricane [14] [15]. The hurricane attained its peak intensity later that night with maximum sustained wind of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 938 millibars (27.70 inHg) at 3:10 UTC on September 27 as it made landfall east of the center of the Aucilla River about 10 miles (16 km) west-southwest of Perry, Florida,  becoming the strongest hurricane to strike Florida's Big Bend region [16] [17]. Rapid weakening occurred as the storm tracked inland, and by the time it reached Georgia at 05:00 UTC the next day, it had weakened into a Category 2 hurricane [18]. Weakening further, it became a tropical storm over east central Georgia a few hours later [19]. After a few hours, it weakened and became a tropical depression near the Kentucky-Tennessee border, northeast of Cookeville, Tennessee [20]. It rapidly became a post-tropical cyclone and eventually dissipated on September 29. [21]. On October 9, researchers with World Weather Attribution concluded with "high confidence" that Helene was made worse by climate change. In a scientific assessment, researchers found that Helene had 10% more rain, had winds that were 13 miles per hour more intense, and drew energy from water that was 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer due to climate change. [clarification needed] This "13 miles per hour" means that the wind speed increased by 11% and as the destruction from hurricanes grew by 50% when the wind speed increased by 5%, climate change increased the destruction from the hurricane by more than twice [22]. Researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that in some parts of Georgia and North Carolina climate change increased the rainfall from the storm by more than 50%. 

# Preparations

## Mexico

The region around Cancún received 240 millimetres (9.4 in) of rain. Over 120,000 customers, 14% of all Comisión Federal de Electricidad customers, lost power in Quintana Roo [28]. Extreme flooding covering much of Isla Mujeres occurred [102]. The island also experienced wind gusts up to 69 miles per hour (111 km/h) [102]. Cancún and Cozumel saw very rough surf, breaking the seawall in Cozumel and increasing beach erosion in Cancún [103]. Flights at Cozumel International Airport were delayed while Cancún International Airport saw nearly 100 cancellations or delays [104]. Only minor delays occurred at Mérida Airport [102]. The companies most affected by Helene were Viva Aerobus, Volaris, and Aeromexico [105]. Trees fell and roofs were damaged across the Yucatán Peninsula [106]. A gas explosion occurred in Cancún during Helene,  but no fatalities were reported [107]. No deaths were reported in Mexico during Helene. [28]. 

## Caribbean

### Cayman Islands

Over 10 inches (250 mm) of rain fell onto the Cayman Islands. Heavy rainfall and large waves began affecting the Cayman Islands on September 24 [108]. Roads in George Town were flooded as rainfall produced by the storm caused 14 power outages, affecting 118 customers across Grand Cayman [109]. The government began planning to buy land to aid in storm water management [34]. After Helene had passed, Grand Cayman was impacted by 5–7 foot (1.5–2.1 m) waves on September 26 [110]. 

### Cuba

In Cuba, heavy rainfall occurred, with peak accumulations of 218.4 mm (8.60 in) recorded in Presa Herradura and 186.8 mm (7.35 in) in Palacios. Elsewhere, Punta del Este and Isla de la Juventud received 101 mm (4.0 in), Paso Real de San Diego received 78 mm (3.1 in), Pinar del Río received 72 mm (2.8 in), and Isabel Rubio received 70 mm (2.8 in) [112]. In Pinar del Río Province, 17 of the province's 24 reservoirs overflowed [113]. Elsewhere, in El Palenque, road access was cut off due to flooding caused by Helene. Helene's winds caused a failure in the power lines that feed the Guanito transmitter, causing most of the territory, especially San Juan and Martínez, Guane, Mantua, and Minas de Matahambre, to suffer blackouts [112]. Gale-force winds were recorded in the provinces of Isla de la Juventud and Pinar del Río [114]. In total, around 70,000 customers experienced power outages in Pinar del Rio, with another 160,000 residents affected in Artemisa [115]. In Havana, one person was injured after an uninhabited building collapsed due to heavy rains, and two landslides occurred. Intense rainfall caused the Cuyaguateje River to rise rapidly, causing flooding in parts of Pinar del Río on September 26 [117]. Flooding also occurred in Mayabeque Province, primarily in the municipalities of Batabanó, Melena del Sur, and San Nicolás de Bari [118] [119]. 

## United States

Initial estimates suggested that insured losses could reach US$3–6 billion, according to reinsurance broker Gallagher Re;  AM Best estimated losses in excess of US$5 billion [140]. Later estimates by Moody's Analytics estimated that the damage could reach US$20–34 billion [141]. AccuWeather estimated that the total damage and economic loss could cost anywhere from US$225–250 billion [142]. At least four million people have lost power, according to the Omaha Public Power District [143]. Agricultural damage is estimated at US$7 billion [144]. Insured losses are expected to be lower than initially estimated due to standard home insurance policies not including flood insurance coverage, increased coverage restrictions by insurers, and hurricane deductibles [145]. On September 27, Delta Air Lines at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport issued travel waivers to people impacted by flight cancellations or delays. They also anticipated that there would be travel disruptions due to the force of Hurricane Helene making it dangerous for airplanes to fly. There were 171 flight cancellations to and from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, most of which were from Charlotte Douglas International Airport and Augusta Regional Airport. There were 489 flight delays, with most of those flight delays from Tampa International Airport, Augusta Regional Airport, and Jacksonville International Airport. These cancellations and delays included Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Westjet Airlines, and many other airlines. A Baxter International manufacturing site in Marion, North Carolina, which produced 60% of the nation's sterile intravenous and kidney dialysis fluids for health facilities, was temporarily closed due to flood damage. The closure of the manufacturing site led to a shortage and rationing of IV fluids across hospitals across the country [149]. The shutdown is anticipated to result in shortages of parenteral IV fluids through the end of 2024 [150]. 

### Florida

By the morning of September 26, 2024, thousands in the Tampa Bay area were experiencing power outages. Wind gusts reached 64 mph (103 km/h) in Fort Lauderdale and 67 mph (108 km/h) in Naples [154]. Storm surges in Steinhatchee reached 9.63 feet (2.94 m) [18]. Key West experienced storm surge of 1 to 3 feet (0.30 to 0.91 m) [155]. Storm surges reached 7.18 feet (2.19 m) in Tampa [156]. Preliminary storm surge modeling has found that areas of the Big Bend experienced inundation of more than 15 feet [157]. About 1.3 million people lost power in the state [158]. The Stan Gober Memorial Bridge shut down due to flooding, and all sporting events in Collier County on September 27 were canceled [159]. Multiple Waffle Houses in Tallahassee and one in Crawfordville shut down, raising the Waffle House Index to red, indicating the possibility of severe damage to the restaurant. Orlando International Airport, remaining open, saw 65 cancellations on September 26, and 92 cancellations occurred at Miami International Airport [161]. The Central Florida Pipeline, which supplies fuel used for jet planes between Tampa and Orlando, was reported to be damaged as a result taking on saltwater during Helene [162] [163]. The pipeline is the only direct source of new jet fuel to Orlando International Airport; the airport is instead relying on trucking in fuel and reserves  Several national parks experienced service disruptions due to the hurricane, with all services suspended at Dry Tortugas National Park due to storm surge [164] [164]. Seventeen fatalities have been reported in Florida, including at least eleven in Pinellas County;   two in Tampa involving a car accident where a sign fell on a car on I-4, along with an elderly woman who drowned inside her house; and one in Dixie County involving a tree falling on a home [166] [167]. Of the deaths in Pinellas, ten have been drownings and one was caused by an electrical fire that started after water rushed into a home [155] [168] [169] [170]. The Taylor County Sheriff's Office posted to social media asking for those who did not evacuate to write their birthday and other important information on their bodies in permanent marker and to email the similar information and their location to them to help search and rescue teams [167]. Pasco County Sheriff's Office rescued around 200 people in water emergencies [171]. In Citrus County, over 100 people and 50 pets were rescued after ten feet of storm surge hit the area [172]. In total, over 1,000 people had to be rescued in the Tampa Bay area [173]. Following the storm surge, multiple buildings in Clearwater Beach caught fire. According to Taylor County sheriff Wayne Padgett, 90% of homes in Keaton Beach were destroyed [175]. At least 24 businesses and 70 homes were also destroyed in Gulfport [176]. In Manatee County, 230,471 structures were affected, with residential damage estimated at $347.2 million, while commercial damage reached $6.3 million, for a combined total of $353.5 million [177]. In Bradenton, 194 homes and seven commercial buildings suffered major damage, with the damage estimated at $41 million total [178] [179]. In total, across Manatee and Sarasota County, the damage is estimated at $1.1 billion, with $755.7 million in Sarasota County, 3,137 buildings are also damaged or destroyed in the county [180]. Despite not directly affecting Volusia County, gale-force gusts downed several trees, with a peak of 53 mph (85 km/h) in the county. More than 9,000 residents were without power as of September 27. In Edgewater, a carport blew over while a tree fell through the roof of a mobile home in the Sea Horse Mobile Home Park. A large tree fell into a duplex-style home through the roof in Seminole County, affected only by the storm's outer bands. Seminole County saw 2,427 people without power, while neighboring Orange County saw 4,476 customers without power [181]. In Apopka, the outer bands tore the roof off of a home. Elsewhere, in Flagler County, the highest gusts recorded were in Marineland, which had winds of 63 mph (101 km/h). Approximately 20,000 residents lost power from September 26 and 27. A tree fell through a roof at home in Palm Coast, while in Palm Beach, a "small scarp" received a local surge of 18 in (460 mm). 

### Georgia

In Atlanta, the National Weather Service in Peachtree City issued the city's first-ever flash flood emergency due to Atlanta having its heaviest 3-day rainfall totals in 104 years. Rainfall totals over 48 hours in the city reached 11.12 in (282 mm), the most the city has seen in 48 hours since recordkeeping began in 1878 [185] [186]. About 25 people had to be rescued from floods in Atlanta [187]. Localized urban flooding was also reported on multiple interstates like I-285, I-85, I-75  and many other interstate systems encompassing Atlanta [188] [189]. More significant flooding occurred in Buckhead due to overflowing of the Peachtree Creek, which flooded multiple surrounding apartment complexes. Other flooding occurred in areas around Metro Atlanta. The Chattahoochee River overflowed its banks in multiple areas around Fulton County, Georgia and in downstream counties which prompted a water rescue in Coweta County [190]. Three tornadoes were spawned by Helene in the state,   including one that killed two people in Wheeler County when it overturned their mobile home [191] [192] [193]. The Wheeler County tornado was rated an EF1, while the other two have been rated EF0 [194]. Rabun County officials ordered the evacuation of people living below a dam at Lake Rabun after officials were forced to open a third floodgate, inundating several roads and trapping people in their communities in the southern part of the county. Four homes were destroyed by falling trees in White County and Habersham County, but no injuries were reported. Rabun County's emergency management department said many roads were left "impassable" by the storm and that most residents were without power into September 27, urging them to stay home to allow rescue and cleanup personnel to work uninterrupted [196]. The Hiwassee River in Towns County crested at over ten feet (3.0 m), just one foot (0.30 m) below the record, and flooded pastures and parts of a campground, but campers were not reached [196]. Over a million customers lost electric power in the state during Helene due to trees falling on power lines across the state and high wind speeds. There are over 400,000 people still without electricity as of September 29. At least 115 structures in Valdosta were heavily damaged [198] [199]. Preliminary damage estimates according to governor Brian Kemp is at US$417 million [200]. The timber industry in the state sustained $1.28 billion in damage [201]. In total, agricultural damages reached $6.46 billion [202]. Helene caused major damage to Georgia's poultry farms, causing damage or total destruction to 107 facilities. Georgia and surrounding regions produce almost half of the 9 billion chickens consumed annually across the United States, and manure runoff from the damaged facilities raised alarms about the quality of streams and groundwater [203]. Injuries and deaths were reported throughout the state, including the two fatalities from the aforementioned tornado in Wheeler County. In total, 34 people died from the storm in the state [194]. 

### South Carolina

Thirty-six people were killed in South Carolina,  including six in Spartanburg County and Greenville County, four in Aiken County, and Anderson County, three in Laurens County, two in Newberry County, one in Chesterfield County,   three in Saluda County, and one in Greenwood County [159] [248] [249]. Over 1.3 million customers were without power in South Carolina, the most of any state impacted by Helene, with several counties experiencing a near-complete loss of power [250]. Wind gusts reached 72 mph (116 km/h) in Aiken and Anderson,  and 75 mph (121 km/h) in Beaufort [169] [251] [249] [252]. Rainfall totals in the state peaked at 21.66 in (550 mm) in Rocky Bottom [253]. Helene spawned 21 weak tornadoes in the state; five of them were rated EF1, another was rated EFU, and the remaining 15 were rated EF0 [254]. Clemson University faced major online backlash  after deciding to host its September 28 homecoming football game against Stanford, bringing 80,295 fans to campus, most of whom were non-locals, at a time when the surrounding upstate, including the nearby city of Clemson and town of Central, were facing widespread power outages and gas shortages [255]. Tailgaters put a heavy strain on already scarce supplies such as gas, hot food from the few local restaurants that remained open, and ice that residents needed to prevent their food from spoiling in the absence of power [256] [257]. Later, on September 28, Clemson University announced that it would be opening some of its powered facilities and offering free food, drinks, ice, charging stations, and showers to the community for members in need of respite following the storm. However, many criticized the university for not doing so sooner. Criticism continued when Clemson University announced that classes would be canceled on Monday, September 30, seemingly contradicting the earlier assertion that the area was recovered well enough to host a game [258]. An electrical power outage led to one South Carolina factory farm losing 45,000 chickens. Millions more likely died due to Helene's effects across the Southeast, where almost half of the chicken farmed for meat in the United States is produced. 

### North Carolina

Although initially up to 115 deaths and more than 200 missing were attributed to Helene in North Carolina, including at least 40 in Buncombe County alone,    that number was later revised down to 103 as it emerged that significant double-counting and mis-allocation had occurred in Buncombe County [204] [205] [206]. Two people, a 4-year-old girl in Claremont and a 58-year-old man in Gastonia, were killed in traffic collisions during rains caused by Helene [207] [208]. At least 879,000 customers in the state lost power [209]. In Charlotte, high winds from Helene caused a tree to fall onto a residence, killing one person and seriously injuring another [210]. In Winston-Salem, heavy rains and high winds caused a large tree to fall on a gas station, damaging two vehicles [211]. Residents living downstream of Lake Lure were ordered to evacuate as its dam was overtopped by water and imminent failure was expected [212] [213]. Lake Lure Dam was later evaluated, and no imminent failure was expected, although erosion on both sides of the dam and compromise of the structural supports were reported. One woman in the town of Lake Lure was rescued with her dog after being stranded inside a collapsed house along a riverbank [214] [215]. Eight tornadoes were spawned by Helene in the state [216]. This included a brief but intense low-end EF3 tornado that impacted the north side of Rocky Mount, damaging 14 buildings and injuring 15 people, including four critically [195]. Five of the other tornadoes were rated EF1, while the remaining two were rated EF0 [217]. Areas in the Black Mountains region in the western part of the state were particularly devastated. Residents of Swannanoa also reported that no search and rescue operations had reached their location as of September 29, leaving several residents who had not prepared for the degree of flooding without food or drinkable water. Data from the National Weather Service indicated that over 19 in (480 mm) of rain fell in areas upstream of Chimney Rock, leading to devastating floodwaters that destroyed half of the village, including half of the businesses on the southern side of the village near the Broad River [218]. The downtown of Elkin was heavily damaged by floodwaters from the Yadkin River [219]. The Catawba River flooded Morganton and left thousands of residents without power [220]. The Oxford Dam, at Lake Hickory on the Catawba River, spilled over [221]. More than 400 roads were closed in the western part of the state, and over 200 people had to be rescued from floods [222]. A curfew was issued for Asheville due to the damage that occurred inside the city. The city broke their record for two-day rainfall, recording 9.87 in (251 mm) of rain [223]. The Asheville Police Department reported that they had made arrests due to looting [224]. The French Broad River crested at 24.67 ft (7.52 m), and the Swannanoa River reached 26.1 ft (8.0 m), both higher than the all-time records set by the Flood of 1916 [225]. Almost the entirety of Biltmore Village and the River Arts District were flooded, and the city was largely isolated due to loss of power and cell service [226]. Landslides around Asheville caused sections of I-26 and I-40 to collapse or wash away, forcing closures of affected routes [228]. Access to Asheville was cut off from September 27–28 via I-26 to South Carolina [229]. A curfew was also issued for Boone after high winds and torrential rain caused flooding, sink holes, and power outages throughout Watauga County [230]. Appalachian State's football game against Liberty was canceled due to flooding and was not rescheduled. A mudslide and floodwaters from the Pigeon River washed out a section of I-40 at the North Carolina–Tennessee border, forcing another closure [232]. The Pigeon River rose to more than 25 feet (7.6 metres) in Canton,  higher than during Hurricane Frances in 2004 and Tropical Storm Fred in 2021 [233] [219]. In Busick, rainfall totals reached 30.78 in (782 mm) [234]. The University of North Carolina at Asheville canceled all classes through October 9 (later extended through October 28), along with Appalachian State campuses of Boone and Hickory through October 11, and Western Carolina University through October 4 [235]. Warren Wilson College and Blue Ridge Community College announced they would remain closed for at least a week [236]. The Asheville School, a boarding school in Asheville, evacuated its students and announced the campus would remain closed until October 14 [237]. Christ School, an all-boys Episcopal boarding school in Arden, was not evacuated and the campus was left without power until October 9 [238]. Classes would resume six days later. The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) issued a statement on their website that all roads in western North Carolina should be considered closed. Lees-McRae College in Banner Elk evacuated their campus and as of September 29, all students were successfully evacuated with the assistance of the North Carolina National Guard [241]. There were various non-specific online posts using antisemitic rhetoric and threatening violence against FEMA officials in the aftermath of the storm. In one instance, federal aid workers briefly paused or relocated their work in Rutherford County, North Carolina, as a result [242] [243]. A 44-year-old North Carolina man was later arrested and charged in the Rutherford County incident after he was found with a handgun and a rifle at a supermarket serving as a storm relief site [244]. The catastrophic flooding and destruction caused by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina likely caused at least a record US$59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. The storm and its aftermath caused 1,400 landslides and damaged over 160 water and sewer systems, at least 6,000 miles (9,650 kilometers) of roads, more than 1,000 bridges and culverts and an estimated 126,000 homes, the budget office said [246]. Some 220,000 households are expected to apply for federal assistance. 

### Elsewhere

LaRue County, Kentucky, experienced up to 3.61 in (92 mm) of rain. A daily rainfall record was broken in Lexington [290]. Wind gusts in Morgan County exceeded 60 mph (97 km/h). Across Kentucky, nearly 220,000 customers lost power. In Jessamine County, the steeple of Edgewood Baptist Church was blown off [291]. In Lexington alone, over 110,000 customers were without power [292]. In West Virginia, heavy rainfall occurred. High water ran in Bluefield, and trees blocked multiple roadways. Elsewhere in the state were fallen trees across parts of Fayette County. In Mercer County, more than 20,000 customers lost power due to Helene. The Denver Broncos, who were practicing at the Greenbrier Resort due to having two consecutive east coast road games, were forced to hold one of their practices in the indoor tennis courts due to the heavy rainfall [294]. Helene's rains have been primarily beneficial, alleviating drought conditions which were in the state since August 2024 [295] [296]. In Huntington, a wind gust of 70 mph (110 km/h) was recorded; which was the second highest wind gust ever recorded at that station [297]. In Illinois, Helene's remnants produced heavy rains and high winds, causing several thousand outages. The waves on Lake Michigan were as high as 10 ft (3.0 m) [299]. Portions of Southern Illinois exceeded 6 in (150 mm) of rain from the storm, which caused water levels on the Ohio River to jump by 15 ft (4.6 m) following the storm [300]. However, the rainfall in this region was largely beneficial due to drought conditions from a lack of rain earlier in the month. About 100,000 power outages occurred in Indiana,  and winds gusted up to 68 mph (109 km/h) [301] [302]. Rainfall in the state peaked at 4.89 in (124 mm) in Mt [303]. Vernon, with 2.02 in (51 mm) of rain in Downtown Indianapolis; heavier rainfall totals occurred in the southern parts of the state. One person was killed due to a fallen tree near Griffin [304]. Over 120,000 customers lost power in Ohio. An estimated 1,000 households have sustained damage in Scioto County due to unexpected heavy rainfall, with 7 in (180 mm) of rain falling within the span of a few hours [305]. 400 damage reports have been filed as of September 30, 2024. In the city of Cincinnati, rainfall totals reached 2.05 in (52 mm) [306]. Wind gusts in the state reached 67 mph (108 km/h) [307]. In the state of Alabama, over 3,000 customers lost power. Isolated regions in Geneva County and Houston County experienced 6–8 in (150–200 mm) of rain [309]. However, a last-second shift to the east lessened impacts throughout the state. In the Northeast, particularly in New York and New Jersey, light moisture from the northeastern quadrants of Helene's remnants associated with a cold front would precipitate over the tri-state area. Rainfall was overall light with breezy conditions across the region [311]. Helene's impacts across the region would be the last measured precipitation in that region until November in a historic dry-spell [312]. 

# Impact

## Honduras

Honduras experienced heavy rains as a result of the Central American gyre which preceded Helene. As a result, the Goascorán River brought flooding to nearby communities located in low-lying areas through Valle and Choluteca departments, reaching a level over .48 feet (0.15 m) [99]. A state of emergency was issued in San Marcos de Colón, Choluteca, due to overall damage caused by the storm [100]. Nearly 30 homes were estimated to be affected in El Cubulero, Alianza, Valle [101]. Due to high waves onshore, 120 families were affected in the coastal town of Marcovia, Choluteca; at least one home was destroyed. Heavy rainfall left communities isolated and 50 people sheltered in El Paraíso due to severe floods. 

## Mexico

The region around Cancún received 240 millimetres (9.4 in) of rain. Over 120,000 customers, 14% of all Comisión Federal de Electricidad customers, lost power in Quintana Roo [28]. Extreme flooding covering much of Isla Mujeres occurred [102]. The island also experienced wind gusts up to 69 miles per hour (111 km/h) [102]. Cancún and Cozumel saw very rough surf, breaking the seawall in Cozumel and increasing beach erosion in Cancún [103]. Flights at Cozumel International Airport were delayed while Cancún International Airport saw nearly 100 cancellations or delays [104]. Only minor delays occurred at Mérida Airport [102]. The companies most affected by Helene were Viva Aerobus, Volaris, and Aeromexico [105]. Trees fell and roofs were damaged across the Yucatán Peninsula [106]. A gas explosion occurred in Cancún during Helene,  but no fatalities were reported [107]. No deaths were reported in Mexico during Helene. [28]. 

## Caribbean

### Cayman Islands

Over 10 inches (250 mm) of rain fell onto the Cayman Islands. Heavy rainfall and large waves began affecting the Cayman Islands on September 24 [108]. Roads in George Town were flooded as rainfall produced by the storm caused 14 power outages, affecting 118 customers across Grand Cayman [109]. The government began planning to buy land to aid in storm water management [34]. After Helene had passed, Grand Cayman was impacted by 5–7 foot (1.5–2.1 m) waves on September 26 [110]. 

### Cuba

In Cuba, heavy rainfall occurred, with peak accumulations of 218.4 mm (8.60 in) recorded in Presa Herradura and 186.8 mm (7.35 in) in Palacios. Elsewhere, Punta del Este and Isla de la Juventud received 101 mm (4.0 in), Paso Real de San Diego received 78 mm (3.1 in), Pinar del Río received 72 mm (2.8 in), and Isabel Rubio received 70 mm (2.8 in) [112]. In Pinar del Río Province, 17 of the province's 24 reservoirs overflowed [113]. Elsewhere, in El Palenque, road access was cut off due to flooding caused by Helene. Helene's winds caused a failure in the power lines that feed the Guanito transmitter, causing most of the territory, especially San Juan and Martínez, Guane, Mantua, and Minas de Matahambre, to suffer blackouts [112]. Gale-force winds were recorded in the provinces of Isla de la Juventud and Pinar del Río [114]. In total, around 70,000 customers experienced power outages in Pinar del Rio, with another 160,000 residents affected in Artemisa [115]. In Havana, one person was injured after an uninhabited building collapsed due to heavy rains, and two landslides occurred. Intense rainfall caused the Cuyaguateje River to rise rapidly, causing flooding in parts of Pinar del Río on September 26 [117]. Flooding also occurred in Mayabeque Province, primarily in the municipalities of Batabanó, Melena del Sur, and San Nicolás de Bari [118] [119]. 

## United States

Initial estimates suggested that insured losses could reach US$3–6 billion, according to reinsurance broker Gallagher Re;  AM Best estimated losses in excess of US$5 billion [140]. Later estimates by Moody's Analytics estimated that the damage could reach US$20–34 billion [141]. AccuWeather estimated that the total damage and economic loss could cost anywhere from US$225–250 billion [142]. At least four million people have lost power, according to the Omaha Public Power District [143]. Agricultural damage is estimated at US$7 billion [144]. Insured losses are expected to be lower than initially estimated due to standard home insurance policies not including flood insurance coverage, increased coverage restrictions by insurers, and hurricane deductibles [145]. On September 27, Delta Air Lines at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport issued travel waivers to people impacted by flight cancellations or delays. They also anticipated that there would be travel disruptions due to the force of Hurricane Helene making it dangerous for airplanes to fly. There were 171 flight cancellations to and from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, most of which were from Charlotte Douglas International Airport and Augusta Regional Airport. There were 489 flight delays, with most of those flight delays from Tampa International Airport, Augusta Regional Airport, and Jacksonville International Airport. These cancellations and delays included Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Westjet Airlines, and many other airlines. A Baxter International manufacturing site in Marion, North Carolina, which produced 60% of the nation's sterile intravenous and kidney dialysis fluids for health facilities, was temporarily closed due to flood damage. The closure of the manufacturing site led to a shortage and rationing of IV fluids across hospitals across the country [149]. The shutdown is anticipated to result in shortages of parenteral IV fluids through the end of 2024 [150]. 

### Florida

By the morning of September 26, 2024, thousands in the Tampa Bay area were experiencing power outages. Wind gusts reached 64 mph (103 km/h) in Fort Lauderdale and 67 mph (108 km/h) in Naples [154]. Storm surges in Steinhatchee reached 9.63 feet (2.94 m) [18]. Key West experienced storm surge of 1 to 3 feet (0.30 to 0.91 m) [155]. Storm surges reached 7.18 feet (2.19 m) in Tampa [156]. Preliminary storm surge modeling has found that areas of the Big Bend experienced inundation of more than 15 feet [157]. About 1.3 million people lost power in the state [158]. The Stan Gober Memorial Bridge shut down due to flooding, and all sporting events in Collier County on September 27 were canceled [159]. Multiple Waffle Houses in Tallahassee and one in Crawfordville shut down, raising the Waffle House Index to red, indicating the possibility of severe damage to the restaurant. Orlando International Airport, remaining open, saw 65 cancellations on September 26, and 92 cancellations occurred at Miami International Airport [161]. The Central Florida Pipeline, which supplies fuel used for jet planes between Tampa and Orlando, was reported to be damaged as a result taking on saltwater during Helene [162] [163]. The pipeline is the only direct source of new jet fuel to Orlando International Airport; the airport is instead relying on trucking in fuel and reserves  Several national parks experienced service disruptions due to the hurricane, with all services suspended at Dry Tortugas National Park due to storm surge [164] [164]. Seventeen fatalities have been reported in Florida, including at least eleven in Pinellas County;   two in Tampa involving a car accident where a sign fell on a car on I-4, along with an elderly woman who drowned inside her house; and one in Dixie County involving a tree falling on a home [166] [167]. Of the deaths in Pinellas, ten have been drownings and one was caused by an electrical fire that started after water rushed into a home [155] [168] [169] [170]. The Taylor County Sheriff's Office posted to social media asking for those who did not evacuate to write their birthday and other important information on their bodies in permanent marker and to email the similar information and their location to them to help search and rescue teams [167]. Pasco County Sheriff's Office rescued around 200 people in water emergencies [171]. In Citrus County, over 100 people and 50 pets were rescued after ten feet of storm surge hit the area [172]. In total, over 1,000 people had to be rescued in the Tampa Bay area [173]. Following the storm surge, multiple buildings in Clearwater Beach caught fire. According to Taylor County sheriff Wayne Padgett, 90% of homes in Keaton Beach were destroyed [175]. At least 24 businesses and 70 homes were also destroyed in Gulfport [176]. In Manatee County, 230,471 structures were affected, with residential damage estimated at $347.2 million, while commercial damage reached $6.3 million, for a combined total of $353.5 million [177]. In Bradenton, 194 homes and seven commercial buildings suffered major damage, with the damage estimated at $41 million total [178] [179]. In total, across Manatee and Sarasota County, the damage is estimated at $1.1 billion, with $755.7 million in Sarasota County, 3,137 buildings are also damaged or destroyed in the county [180]. Despite not directly affecting Volusia County, gale-force gusts downed several trees, with a peak of 53 mph (85 km/h) in the county. More than 9,000 residents were without power as of September 27. In Edgewater, a carport blew over while a tree fell through the roof of a mobile home in the Sea Horse Mobile Home Park. A large tree fell into a duplex-style home through the roof in Seminole County, affected only by the storm's outer bands. Seminole County saw 2,427 people without power, while neighboring Orange County saw 4,476 customers without power [181]. In Apopka, the outer bands tore the roof off of a home. Elsewhere, in Flagler County, the highest gusts recorded were in Marineland, which had winds of 63 mph (101 km/h). Approximately 20,000 residents lost power from September 26 and 27. A tree fell through a roof at home in Palm Coast, while in Palm Beach, a "small scarp" received a local surge of 18 in (460 mm). 

### Georgia

In Atlanta, the National Weather Service in Peachtree City issued the city's first-ever flash flood emergency due to Atlanta having its heaviest 3-day rainfall totals in 104 years. Rainfall totals over 48 hours in the city reached 11.12 in (282 mm), the most the city has seen in 48 hours since recordkeeping began in 1878 [185] [186]. About 25 people had to be rescued from floods in Atlanta [187]. Localized urban flooding was also reported on multiple interstates like I-285, I-85, I-75  and many other interstate systems encompassing Atlanta [188] [189]. More significant flooding occurred in Buckhead due to overflowing of the Peachtree Creek, which flooded multiple surrounding apartment complexes. Other flooding occurred in areas around Metro Atlanta. The Chattahoochee River overflowed its banks in multiple areas around Fulton County, Georgia and in downstream counties which prompted a water rescue in Coweta County [190]. Three tornadoes were spawned by Helene in the state,   including one that killed two people in Wheeler County when it overturned their mobile home [191] [192] [193]. The Wheeler County tornado was rated an EF1, while the other two have been rated EF0 [194]. Rabun County officials ordered the evacuation of people living below a dam at Lake Rabun after officials were forced to open a third floodgate, inundating several roads and trapping people in their communities in the southern part of the county. Four homes were destroyed by falling trees in White County and Habersham County, but no injuries were reported. Rabun County's emergency management department said many roads were left "impassable" by the storm and that most residents were without power into September 27, urging them to stay home to allow rescue and cleanup personnel to work uninterrupted [196]. The Hiwassee River in Towns County crested at over ten feet (3.0 m), just one foot (0.30 m) below the record, and flooded pastures and parts of a campground, but campers were not reached [196]. Over a million customers lost electric power in the state during Helene due to trees falling on power lines across the state and high wind speeds. There are over 400,000 people still without electricity as of September 29. At least 115 structures in Valdosta were heavily damaged [198] [199]. Preliminary damage estimates according to governor Brian Kemp is at US$417 million [200]. The timber industry in the state sustained $1.28 billion in damage [201]. In total, agricultural damages reached $6.46 billion [202]. Helene caused major damage to Georgia's poultry farms, causing damage or total destruction to 107 facilities. Georgia and surrounding regions produce almost half of the 9 billion chickens consumed annually across the United States, and manure runoff from the damaged facilities raised alarms about the quality of streams and groundwater [203]. Injuries and deaths were reported throughout the state, including the two fatalities from the aforementioned tornado in Wheeler County. In total, 34 people died from the storm in the state [194]. 

### North Carolina

Although initially up to 115 deaths and more than 200 missing were attributed to Helene in North Carolina, including at least 40 in Buncombe County alone,    that number was later revised down to 103 as it emerged that significant double-counting and mis-allocation had occurred in Buncombe County [204] [205] [206]. Two people, a 4-year-old girl in Claremont and a 58-year-old man in Gastonia, were killed in traffic collisions during rains caused by Helene [207] [208]. At least 879,000 customers in the state lost power [209]. In Charlotte, high winds from Helene caused a tree to fall onto a residence, killing one person and seriously injuring another [210]. In Winston-Salem, heavy rains and high winds caused a large tree to fall on a gas station, damaging two vehicles [211]. Residents living downstream of Lake Lure were ordered to evacuate as its dam was overtopped by water and imminent failure was expected [212] [213]. Lake Lure Dam was later evaluated, and no imminent failure was expected, although erosion on both sides of the dam and compromise of the structural supports were reported. One woman in the town of Lake Lure was rescued with her dog after being stranded inside a collapsed house along a riverbank [214] [215]. Eight tornadoes were spawned by Helene in the state [216]. This included a brief but intense low-end EF3 tornado that impacted the north side of Rocky Mount, damaging 14 buildings and injuring 15 people, including four critically [195]. Five of the other tornadoes were rated EF1, while the remaining two were rated EF0 [217]. Areas in the Black Mountains region in the western part of the state were particularly devastated. Residents of Swannanoa also reported that no search and rescue operations had reached their location as of September 29, leaving several residents who had not prepared for the degree of flooding without food or drinkable water. Data from the National Weather Service indicated that over 19 in (480 mm) of rain fell in areas upstream of Chimney Rock, leading to devastating floodwaters that destroyed half of the village, including half of the businesses on the southern side of the village near the Broad River [218]. The downtown of Elkin was heavily damaged by floodwaters from the Yadkin River [219]. The Catawba River flooded Morganton and left thousands of residents without power [220]. The Oxford Dam, at Lake Hickory on the Catawba River, spilled over [221]. More than 400 roads were closed in the western part of the state, and over 200 people had to be rescued from floods [222]. A curfew was issued for Asheville due to the damage that occurred inside the city. The city broke their record for two-day rainfall, recording 9.87 in (251 mm) of rain [223]. The Asheville Police Department reported that they had made arrests due to looting [224]. The French Broad River crested at 24.67 ft (7.52 m), and the Swannanoa River reached 26.1 ft (8.0 m), both higher than the all-time records set by the Flood of 1916 [225]. Almost the entirety of Biltmore Village and the River Arts District were flooded, and the city was largely isolated due to loss of power and cell service [226]. Landslides around Asheville caused sections of I-26 and I-40 to collapse or wash away, forcing closures of affected routes [228]. Access to Asheville was cut off from September 27–28 via I-26 to South Carolina [229]. A curfew was also issued for Boone after high winds and torrential rain caused flooding, sink holes, and power outages throughout Watauga County [230]. Appalachian State's football game against Liberty was canceled due to flooding and was not rescheduled. A mudslide and floodwaters from the Pigeon River washed out a section of I-40 at the North Carolina–Tennessee border, forcing another closure [232]. The Pigeon River rose to more than 25 feet (7.6 metres) in Canton,  higher than during Hurricane Frances in 2004 and Tropical Storm Fred in 2021 [233] [219]. In Busick, rainfall totals reached 30.78 in (782 mm) [234]. The University of North Carolina at Asheville canceled all classes through October 9 (later extended through October 28), along with Appalachian State campuses of Boone and Hickory through October 11, and Western Carolina University through October 4 [235]. Warren Wilson College and Blue Ridge Community College announced they would remain closed for at least a week [236]. The Asheville School, a boarding school in Asheville, evacuated its students and announced the campus would remain closed until October 14 [237]. Christ School, an all-boys Episcopal boarding school in Arden, was not evacuated and the campus was left without power until October 9 [238]. Classes would resume six days later. The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) issued a statement on their website that all roads in western North Carolina should be considered closed. Lees-McRae College in Banner Elk evacuated their campus and as of September 29, all students were successfully evacuated with the assistance of the North Carolina National Guard [241]. There were various non-specific online posts using antisemitic rhetoric and threatening violence against FEMA officials in the aftermath of the storm. In one instance, federal aid workers briefly paused or relocated their work in Rutherford County, North Carolina, as a result [242] [243]. A 44-year-old North Carolina man was later arrested and charged in the Rutherford County incident after he was found with a handgun and a rifle at a supermarket serving as a storm relief site [244]. The catastrophic flooding and destruction caused by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina likely caused at least a record US$59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. The storm and its aftermath caused 1,400 landslides and damaged over 160 water and sewer systems, at least 6,000 miles (9,650 kilometers) of roads, more than 1,000 bridges and culverts and an estimated 126,000 homes, the budget office said [246]. Some 220,000 households are expected to apply for federal assistance. 

### South Carolina

Thirty-six people were killed in South Carolina,  including six in Spartanburg County and Greenville County, four in Aiken County, and Anderson County, three in Laurens County, two in Newberry County, one in Chesterfield County,   three in Saluda County, and one in Greenwood County [159] [248] [249]. Over 1.3 million customers were without power in South Carolina, the most of any state impacted by Helene, with several counties experiencing a near-complete loss of power [250]. Wind gusts reached 72 mph (116 km/h) in Aiken and Anderson,  and 75 mph (121 km/h) in Beaufort [169] [251] [249] [252]. Rainfall totals in the state peaked at 21.66 in (550 mm) in Rocky Bottom [253]. Helene spawned 21 weak tornadoes in the state; five of them were rated EF1, another was rated EFU, and the remaining 15 were rated EF0 [254]. Clemson University faced major online backlash  after deciding to host its September 28 homecoming football game against Stanford, bringing 80,295 fans to campus, most of whom were non-locals, at a time when the surrounding upstate, including the nearby city of Clemson and town of Central, were facing widespread power outages and gas shortages [255]. Tailgaters put a heavy strain on already scarce supplies such as gas, hot food from the few local restaurants that remained open, and ice that residents needed to prevent their food from spoiling in the absence of power [256] [257]. Later, on September 28, Clemson University announced that it would be opening some of its powered facilities and offering free food, drinks, ice, charging stations, and showers to the community for members in need of respite following the storm. However, many criticized the university for not doing so sooner. Criticism continued when Clemson University announced that classes would be canceled on Monday, September 30, seemingly contradicting the earlier assertion that the area was recovered well enough to host a game [258]. An electrical power outage led to one South Carolina factory farm losing 45,000 chickens. Millions more likely died due to Helene's effects across the Southeast, where almost half of the chicken farmed for meat in the United States is produced. 

### Tennessee

Helicopter crews rescued 58 people, with units from the Virginia State Police assisting, from Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin after the hospital was almost entirely submerged. Part of a set of bridges on US 23/I-26/US 19W spanning the Nolichucky River in Erwin were completely washed away [260]. The Nashville Predators postponed a preseason game against the Tampa Bay Lightning to October 7 due to severe weather in the area [261] [262]. Nashville broke a daily rainfall record on September 27 [263]. In Morristown, several trees fell, causing power lines to be snapped throughout the city [264]. Wind gusts in Sparta reached 44 mph (71 km/h) [265]. In Newport, the Pigeon River rose to over three times the flood stage and set a new record at 26 feet (7.9 m), flooding portions of the town and nearby I-40 [266]. As of October 1, 2024, across northeastern Tennessee, 85 people were still missing [267]. Early on September 28, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) utility company issued a Condition Red alert for the Nolichucky Dam, saying that a failure of the dam was imminent, and local authorities issued an evacuation order. However, it was reported by late morning the same day that water levels along the Nolichucky River were lowering [269]. The TVA was investigating the dam to figure out the next steps. 12 mi (19 km) northeast of the Nolichucky Dam, the Kinser Bridge, which is a part of SR 107, usually 60 ft (18 m) above the Nolichucky River, collapsed after floodwaters overran the bridge [270]. A total of five state-maintained bridges were destroyed [271]. A K-9 for the Erwin Police Department named Scotty was found dead on September 28 after going missing during flooding in the Bumpus Cove community [272]. Six employees who were trapped by flood waters at the Impact Plastics plant in Erwin were among the missing and dead, with one worker who survived and family members of the deceased saying workers were not told that they could leave until after flood waters had covered the road to the plant and it lost power [273]. Impact Plastics released a statement expressing sympathy for the workers' deaths and said that employees had not been threatened with termination for leaving the plant. The incident is under investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation [274] [275] [276]. Following the storm, four state parks fully closed, with Panther Creek State Park experiencing trail closures and Seven Islands State Birding Park having both trail and boat ramp closures. Hurricane Helene caused a total agricultural and forestry loss of $1.351 billion [278]. 

### Virginia

One person was killed in Craig County after a tree fell onto a building. Another person was killed in Tazewell County when a falling tree struck them as they were cleaning debris [279]. Rainfall reached 12.2 in (310 mm) in the Grayson Highlands,  while Galax saw around 8.6 in (220 mm) of rain over a 72-hour period [280] [281]. In the New River Valley, high waters from Helene were seen as far north as Radford University. Damascus saw flooding of 19.5 ft (5.9 m). Over 70 water rescue operations occurred in the state, with the Virginia National Guard rappelling from helicopters and pulling people from cars. In Albemarle County, one road was washed out. Elsewhere, SR 670 in Madison County and SR 637 in Greene County suffered heavy damage. Claytor Lake would suffer heavy pollution, with officials noting that their teams had found propane tanks and floating cars behind the dam. In Pulaski County, initial estimates revealed that 45 homes were significantly impacted [282]. At the same time, in Giles County, more than 35 buildings were destroyed. Most of US 21 along the mountainside outside of Independence in Grayson County was destroyed, while US 58 and Virginia Creeper Trail were wiped out and will need to be rebuilt headed into Damascus. Access to Taylors Valley in Washington County was cut off after the two bridges into the community were destroyed. In the city of Radford, the New River crested at 31.03 ft (9.46 m), only being surpassed by a 35.96 ft (10.96 m) crest on August 14, 1940, due to the remnants of the 1940 South Carolina hurricane [283]. An EF1 tornado caused minor damage in Bedford County, while an EF2 tornado in Pittsylvania County injured one person, damaged 30 structures, and destroyed a mobile home. Another EF1 tornado blew down trees near Keeling as well [284]. Power outages in the state affected 190,000 people [195]. Following the storm, nine state parks and four preserves closed due to damage from Helene. In addition, numerous trails were closed in Shenandoah National Park [286]. The entire Blue Ridge Parkway was closed as well, though much of the Virginia segment of the highway re-opened on October 11 [287]. Virginia suffered $4.1 billion in agricultural damage and mitigation, this made Helene the costliest tropical cyclone in Virginian history [288]. 

### Elsewhere

LaRue County, Kentucky, experienced up to 3.61 in (92 mm) of rain. A daily rainfall record was broken in Lexington [290]. Wind gusts in Morgan County exceeded 60 mph (97 km/h). Across Kentucky, nearly 220,000 customers lost power. In Jessamine County, the steeple of Edgewood Baptist Church was blown off [291]. In Lexington alone, over 110,000 customers were without power [292]. In West Virginia, heavy rainfall occurred. High water ran in Bluefield, and trees blocked multiple roadways. Elsewhere in the state were fallen trees across parts of Fayette County. In Mercer County, more than 20,000 customers lost power due to Helene. The Denver Broncos, who were practicing at the Greenbrier Resort due to having two consecutive east coast road games, were forced to hold one of their practices in the indoor tennis courts due to the heavy rainfall [294]. Helene's rains have been primarily beneficial, alleviating drought conditions which were in the state since August 2024 [295] [296]. In Huntington, a wind gust of 70 mph (110 km/h) was recorded; which was the second highest wind gust ever recorded at that station [297]. In Illinois, Helene's remnants produced heavy rains and high winds, causing several thousand outages. The waves on Lake Michigan were as high as 10 ft (3.0 m) [299]. Portions of Southern Illinois exceeded 6 in (150 mm) of rain from the storm, which caused water levels on the Ohio River to jump by 15 ft (4.6 m) following the storm [300]. However, the rainfall in this region was largely beneficial due to drought conditions from a lack of rain earlier in the month. About 100,000 power outages occurred in Indiana,  and winds gusted up to 68 mph (109 km/h) [301] [302]. Rainfall in the state peaked at 4.89 in (124 mm) in Mt [303]. Vernon, with 2.02 in (51 mm) of rain in Downtown Indianapolis; heavier rainfall totals occurred in the southern parts of the state. One person was killed due to a fallen tree near Griffin [304]. Over 120,000 customers lost power in Ohio. An estimated 1,000 households have sustained damage in Scioto County due to unexpected heavy rainfall, with 7 in (180 mm) of rain falling within the span of a few hours [305]. 400 damage reports have been filed as of September 30, 2024. In the city of Cincinnati, rainfall totals reached 2.05 in (52 mm) [306]. Wind gusts in the state reached 67 mph (108 km/h) [307]. In the state of Alabama, over 3,000 customers lost power. Isolated regions in Geneva County and Houston County experienced 6–8 in (150–200 mm) of rain [309]. However, a last-second shift to the east lessened impacts throughout the state. In the Northeast, particularly in New York and New Jersey, light moisture from the northeastern quadrants of Helene's remnants associated with a cold front would precipitate over the tri-state area. Rainfall was overall light with breezy conditions across the region [311]. Helene's impacts across the region would be the last measured precipitation in that region until November in a historic dry-spell [312]. 

# Aftermath

## Relief efforts

On September 28, 2024, the Omaha Public Power District sent Mutual Aid crews to West Virginia to help with power restoration after Helene, their third in a disaster in 2024. California sent 151 search and rescue members to affected areas [144]. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent in search-and-rescue teams, bottled water, and Starlink terminals . Additionally, an eastern Kentucky storm chaser contributed 30 Starlink terminals to storm victims in western North Carolina [318]. In total SpaceX stated that they had donated approximately 500 terminals through various channels [319]. The American Red Cross  and The Salvation Army,  among other nonprofit organizations, began deploying emergency disaster services teams in many affected areas [320] [321] [322]. A unit from the 1st Battalion of the 169th Aviation Regiment, part of the Connecticut Army National Guard, was deployed to North Carolina to help assist disaster relief efforts. T&T Line Construction of Hornwell, New Brunswick, Canada sent 11 line crews to Western North Carolina through its mutual assistance agreement with Duke Energy [323]. “Companies from the US aid us in storms; it’s a mutual thing” said a T&T crew leader. Several crews from Quebec, Canada were also seen working around Woodfin NC. Duke also used helicopters not only to transport power poles to Henderson County NC but also to set the poles into the ground, a difficult and complex undertaking [324]. Two other line workers hiked 1.5 miles over very rough ground to bring a power line into the Ashville NC Veterans’ Administration Medical Center that had gone dark due to the storm [325]. Pack mules were utilized to access areas inaccessible by other means in North Carolina. Operation AirDrop and the Carolina Emergency Response Team helped deploy volunteer private helicopter pilots to assist in rescue efforts [327]. As of October 1, the White House reported via press release that FEMA had given out 6.5 million liters of water and 7.1 million meals. World Central Kitchen would deploy food trucks to hurricane struck areas, proving more than 64,000 meals in multiple states affected [330] [331]. The owner of a local Mellow Mushroom would give away $5000 of free pizza to Asheville residents [330]. On October 9,  Anat Sultan-Dadon brought emergency supplies to the community of North Augusta, South Carolina [330]. The international non-profit agency SmartAID also coordinated with communities in North Carolina and Florida to provide limited electricity and communications systems in areas impacted by Helene [332]. On October 1, West Virginia Governor Jim Justice declared a state of emergency in Mercer County which allowed the West Virginia Emergency Management Division to implement the Emergency Operations Plan, allowing swift mobilization of personnel, resources, and essential emergency services. Justice said of the emergency declaration that it "will allow us to speed up the response on the ground and potentially receive federal assistance as we push forward with recovery efforts". The National Football League (NFL), in collaboration with the Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers, Houston Texans, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers via the NFL Foundation, donated $8 million to the relief effort. The quarterbacks of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Baker Mayfield, and the Atlanta Falcons, Kirk Cousins, both donated $50,000 as well [335]. The Major League Baseball (MLB) team, the New York Yankees, donated $1.25 million to American Red Cross relief efforts via the New York Yankees Foundation [336]. The Tampa Bay Rays and their USL Championship team, the Tampa Bay Rowdies, pledged $1 million towards local relief efforts [337]. The National Hockey League (NHL) team, the Carolina Hurricanes, donated their ticket revenue from their game against the Nashville Predators on October 2, totaling $235,000 [338]. In addition to the donated ticket revenue, the team held an auction for merchandise and a meet-and-greet with players to raise over $300,000 in total towards relief efforts, while the Tampa Bay Lightning donated $3 million in collaboration with Ferman Motor Car Company Inc. towards relief efforts. The National Basketball Association (NBA) team, the Charlotte Hornets, committed $1 million towards the American Red Cross and the Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina [339] [340]. Dolly Parton announced that she will donate $2 million to relief efforts, $1 million personally and another $1 million through her various businesses and the Dollywood Foundation [341]. Taylor Swift donated $5 million to Feeding America's relief efforts for Helene and Hurricane Milton, which impacted Florida less than two weeks after Helene [342]. A surge in air traffic over the disaster area occurred due to relief efforts, with an estimated 300% increase in air traffic over western North Carolina alone. The Federal Aviation Administration and the North Carolina Department of Transportation's Division of Aviation issued warnings and restrictions to prevent aerial accidents such as issuing temporary flight restrictions for drones, implementing prior permission request lines, creating temporary airspace coordination areas, creating Standard-use Army Aircraft Flight Routes, and deploying temporary air traffic control towers. The restrictions came in the wake of a report of approximately 30 mid-air close calls over North Carolina on September 28 alone and at least two incidents with private aircraft attempting to drop off supplies, including a plane whose landing gear failed to deploy before landing at Hickory Regional Airport, causing a temporary closure of the runway, and another which caught fire [344] [345]. On October 4, Elon Musk claimed on a post on X that FEMA was not allowing SpaceX personnel to deliver Starlink terminals to areas affected by Hurricane Helene and that the air space had been shut down. Roughly an hour later, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg responded to Musk on X by rejecting his claims, saying that the "FAA doesn’t block legitimate rescue and recovery flights" and offering to discuss any potential issues over the phone [348]. Musk then later posted on social media that he'd talked to Buttigieg and thanked him for talking with him and subsequently commented that Buttigieg had resolved the issue [349]. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on October 5 requiring debris management sites and landfills located within all counties impacted by Helene to remain open 24/7 until conditions deteriorate in order to help facilitate the quick removal of debris in anticipation of Hurricane Milton making landfall in the state. The order also increased the number of Florida National Guardsmen working on debris removal from 800 to 4,000 to try and prevent the debris becoming a hazard ahead of Milton's anticipated landfall. Milton dumped 16 in (410 mm) of rain on Hillsborough County,  following its landfall south of the Tampa Bay area, near Siesta Key, as a Category 3 hurricane on October 9 [353]. Flooding, along with additional damage, adversely affected Helene cleanup efforts in the region [354]. In response, Bay Area nonprofits expanded their relief work [353]. Also, additional Federal disaster assistance was made available to the state to supplement recovery efforts in the areas affected by Milton [355]. Florida recorded a rise in cases of Vibrio vulnificus (a flesh eating bacteria that favors warm waters and spreads in heavy flood rains) following Hurricane Helene, which Hurricane Milton exacerbated. Prior to Helene, 6 cases had been reported in September; by the end of the month that number had risen to 24. As of October 18, there had been 38 confirmed cases statewide, equaling the total number of cases in 2024 prior the hurricanes. 

## Political response

President Biden was criticized by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and other Republican politicians for visiting Rehoboth Beach, Delaware over the weekend instead of being at the White House commanding the federal response. Biden disputed claims that he was not helping to command the federal response to the disaster and stated that he had been doing so over the phone [357]. Biden also said that he might have to ask Congress to return to Washington, D.C. to pass supplemental funding for the federal government's response to Helene. Biden promised to visit the emergency operations center in Raleigh on October 2 before embarking on an aerial tour of Asheville before visiting Georgia and Florida "as soon as possible after that". Democratic party presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris also promised to be "on the ground" as soon as possible without interrupting emergency response operations. On September 30, Harris boarded Air Force Two en route to Joint Base Andrews to visit FEMA headquarters in Washington, D.C. for a briefing on support for emergency response and recovery efforts from the results of Hurricane Helene. In response to reporters' questions about the relation between climate change and the hurricane's severity, the head of FEMA, Deanne Criswell, said climate change made the storm significantly worse. Later, when reporters asked President Biden if climate change is to blame for the damage done by the hurricane he answered: "Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes." [359] [360] [361]. On September 30, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump visited Valdosta, Georgia and alleged that Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, was "having a hard time getting the president  [Joe Biden] on the phone. Federal government is not being responsive.” Biden responded that Trump was "lying" as Biden said he had spoken to Kemp. The federal government was "doing everything possible", while Kemp said that Biden "just called me yesterday afternoon  [on September 29] — I missed him and called him right back ... [Biden] just said, 'Hey, what do you need?' And I told him, 'You know, we got what we need, we will work through the federal process.' He offered that if there's other things we need, just to call him directly, which, I appreciate that. But we've had FEMA embedded with us since, you know, a day or two before the storm hit."    Trump also claimed without providing evidence on his social media platform, Truth Social, that the federal government and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper were "going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas" [362] [363] [364]. On October 1, the U.S. senators from North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia wrote a letter to Senate leadership urging action to help their states, even if it meant returning early from the fall recess. However, a day later, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said that lawmakers would not return early saying that, "We wouldn't even conceivably have the request ready before we get back in November" due to uncertainties about the cost of the disaster and that there was "no necessity" for a return [330]. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said that the costly relief effort would use most of FEMA's funding for the year and that the agency would be unprepared for another major disaster. That same day, Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina Mark Robinson, tweeted claims that Biden had told reporters that there were "no more supplies" for North Carolinians that were impacted by the storm [366]. When asked for proof of the comment being said, reporters were given a video clip of Biden on September 29 responding to a question about any additional supplies being made available, with Biden stating "no, we have pre-planned a significant amount of  [resources], even though they hadn’t asked for it yet." [367]. On October 2, President Biden flew to Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport aboard Air Force One and met with South Carolina officials such as Senator Lindsey Graham and Governor Henry McMaster to discuss the federal response to Helene in the state before boarding Marine One and traveling to North Carolina to embark on an aerial tour of Asheville and Lake Lure. Biden was joined by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, FEMA director Deanne Criswell, and Homeland Security Advisor Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall. According to Alejandro Mayorkas, the tour was done from the air using Marine One not to impede the emergency response on the ground [368]. Biden also ordered the Department of Defense to deploy up to 1,000 active-duty troops to assist with aid efforts. After Biden's visit, Graham said in a press conference that Biden needed to intervene in the port strike due to it potentially jeopardizing the relief efforts in the Carolinas [366]. McMaster said that he and Graham also suggested to Biden during his visit that he intervene in the strike as well. Vice President Kamala Harris visited Augusta, Georgia, and spoke with residents of the city whom Helene impacted [369]. Harris met with Augusta residents, handed out supplies, spoke about underway relief efforts, and thanked local and state officials such as Augusta Mayor Garnett Johnson. Harris also visited a Red Cross relief center where she received a briefing from local officials about the situation. On October 3, President Biden flew to Tallahassee International Airport aboard Air Force One where he then embarked on another aerial tour aboard Marine One of impacted areas while en route to Perry. From Perry, Biden then traveled via motorcade to Keaton Beach where he was joined by Senator Rick Scott and other local officials. Biden spoke to a couple whose home had been destroyed by storm surge and discussed the impacts of the storm with local emergency management officials before returning to Perry where he boarded Marine One and then flew to Moody Air Force Base in Georgia. From Moody Air Force Base, Biden traveled to Shiloh Pecan Farm southwest of Ray City where he said it was time to put aside "rabid partisanship" to help get people relief [371]. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack accompanied Biden at the farm and he spoke about federal programs to help farmers recover. Also on October 3, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene posted online a map showing many Republican-leaning areas affected by Hurricane Helene, stating that "hurricane devastation could affect the election", then separately stated: "Yes they can control the weather … It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can't be done”; the precise meaning of this statement has not been confirmed [372]. On October 3, Trump falsely accused the Biden administration of spending FEMA funds meant for disaster relief "on illegal migrants", and thus having "stole the FEMA money just like they stole it from a bank"; he repeated the accusations the next day, which the Biden administration claimed was "poison". FEMA stated they have separate Congress-approved funds for disaster relief and for migrants (the Shelter and Service Program) [375] [376].
