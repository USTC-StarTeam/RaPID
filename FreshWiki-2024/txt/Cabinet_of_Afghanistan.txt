Cabinet_of_Afghanistan

The Cabinet of Afghanistan (also known as the Council of Ministers) is the executive body of the government of the country, responsible for day-to-day governance and the implementation of policy set by the Leadership. In his modern form it exists since the beginning of the reign of Emir Amanullah Khan in 1919. 
The current Council of Ministers of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is headed by the prime minister—who serves as the nation's head of government—and his deputies, and consists of the heads and deputy heads of the government ministries.

# Predecessors to a cabinet

## 18th century

When Ahmad Shah Durrani started ruling over his empire in 1747, he had no administrative experience, nor did much of his closest advisors. As a result, he chose to adopt a government style similar to the Mughals and Safavids, with his main idea of a government based off an absolute monarchy. A tribal council ruled in hand with Ahmad Shah as well, serving as a form of cabinet. However, Ahmad Shah had made the positions of his cabinet hereditary, thus making it difficult to dismiss advisors without causing conflict. Their roles, however, were mostly purely de-jure, and tasks were delegated to subordinates. His grandson Zaman Shah had wanted a ministry and cabinet that would be loyal to him and of his people, as a result he had replaced the old ministry of his father Timur Shah and replaced them with loyal Pashtuns devoted to himself, strengthening his position on the throne.. 

## 19th century

When Emir Abdur Rahman Khan came to power in Kabul in 1880, the central administration consisted of only ten clerks overseen by a single official. Using the military branch as a supervisory body, he established a civil administration that, in a modified form, remains in place today. He introduced institutions that were precursors to modern ministries, such as the Treasury Board, Board of Trade, Bureau of Justice and Police, Department of Public Works, Office of Posts and Communications, Department of Education, and Department of Medicine. Despite his autocratic rule, Abdur Rahman Khan created a Supreme Council, similar to a modern cabinet. However, this council had no prime minister and no real power, serving only in an advisory capacity. Its members included high-ranking officials like the Lord Chamberlain ('Ishik Aghasi' or Shahghasi), the Seal Keeper, the Chief Secretary, secretaries appointed by the Amir, officers of the Royal Guard, the Treasurer of the Amir’s private wealth, the Secretary of State for War, regional Secretaries of State, the Postmaster General, the Commander-in-Chief, the Master of the Horse, the Kotwal (equivalent to an Interior Minister), the Accountant General, the Chief Chamberlain, the Superintendent of the Armory, and heads of the Trade and Education Boards. 

## Early 20th century

In 1914, counselors advised Emir Habibullah Khan on different political issues and had some form of authority. With Emir Amanullah Khan's ascension to the throne on 28 February 1919, amidst numerous political reforms, the Council of Ministers, headed by Amanullah himself, was established, creating the first well-structured cabinet in the history of Afghanistan [7] [11]. 

# Emirate of Afghanistan under Habibullah Khan (1901–1919)

# Emirate/Kingdom of Afghanistan under Amanullah Khan (1919–1929)

# Kingdom of Afghanistan under Nadir Shah and Zahir Shah (1929–1973)

# Republic of Afghanistan (1973–1978)

# Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1978–1992)

# Islamic State of Afghanistan (1992–1996)

# Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996–2001)

This government was only recognized by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, though Pakistan and the United Emirates later withdrew their recognition after the September 11 attacks. All other states continued to recognize the Islamic State of Afghanistan.. 

# Afghan Interim Administration and Afghan Transitional Administration (2001–2004)

## Karzai interim cabinet (2001–2002)

Following the late 2001 ouster of the Taliban regime approximately two dozen leading Afghans met in Germany at the Bonn Conference to choose a leadership and set in place a timeline for the adoption of a new constitution for a new Afghan government, and the timeline for choosing an executive and legislature by democratic election. In the chart below is the list of members of the Interim Afghan authority [349]. The Afghan Interim Administration (AIA) was the first administration of Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban regime and was the highest authority of the country from 22 December 2001 until 13 July 2002.. 

## Karzai transitional cabinet (2002–2004)

The Bonn conference of December 2001 had installed an interim government, the 2002 Loya Jirga subsequently elected a transitional administration. From July 2002 until the presidential elections in October 2004, the Transitional Administration governed Afghanistan.. 

# Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2004–2021)

From the 2001 United States invasion of Afghanistan through to the August 2021 Fall of Kabul, Afghanistan had interim and transitional administrations, followed by cabinets of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan starting in 2004. These are listed below from latest to earliest.. During the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the president selected the members of cabinet with the approval of the National Assembly. Candidates for a ministerial position had to be an Afghan citizen, be at least 35 years of age and have higher education. Ministers, unlike the president and vice presidents, could have citizenship of another country, although in 2017 the Wolesi Jirga had rejected ministers who had dual citizenship [350]. 

## First Karzai cabinet (2004–2009)

In the line chart below is the list of members of the Afghan Cabinet from 2004 to 2009. 

## Second Karzai cabinet (2009–2014)

After winning a second term, President Hamid Karzai nominated 23 ministers in December 2009 to be part of his new administration but only 7 were approved by the National Assembly. All the other candidates that Karzai initially selected were rejected by members of the National Assembly. Karzai presented a second list of 18 candidates to the Wolesi Jirga on 9 January 2010 [358]. A week later, the Wolesi Jirga again approved only seven of the candidates. Since then, part of the ministries have been governed by acting ministers who do not held approval of the Afghan legislature. [359]. In June 2010, after the resignation of Interior Minister Hanif Atmar, President Karzai submitted 7 names for a third round of confirmation in the National Assembly. Five of them were approved by the National Assembly, leaving only six of the 25 ministries left with an 'acting minister.'  In the line chart below is the list of members of the current Afghan Cabinet (2009–2014) [361]. 

# Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (2021–present)

Following the fall of Kabul to Taliban Forces on 15 August 2021, tentative nominations to the cabinet were announced in late August 2021. The Taliban said in early September 2021 that women would not be allowed to "work in high-ranking posts" in the government  and "ruled out" women in the cabinet [366]. On 24 August 2021, Fawzia Koofi, a former member of the Afghan National Assembly, had said that a men-only government would "not be complete" [367]. Early September street protests by women in Herat and Kabul called for women to be included in the new government [368]. A men-only "caretaker cabinet"  was appointed by Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada on 7 September 2021 [371]. BBC News stated that the Ministry of Women's Affairs appeared to have been abolished [372] [373]. Another two veterans were named two weeks later as deputies [373]. Afghanistan's main political parties objected to the choice of acting Cabinet members as non-inclusive, with Jamiat-e Islami describing it as "more monopolist and extremist in politics and power than the previous imposed leaders", and Atta Muhammad Nur seeing it as a "sign of hegemony, monopoly and a return to the past" [385]. As of 29 January 2022, no other country had formally recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as the de facto government of Afghanistan.
