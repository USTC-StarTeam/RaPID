2024_Haryana_Legislative_Assembly_election

The 2024 Haryana Legislative Assembly elections were held in Haryana on 5 October 2024 to elect all 90 members of the Haryana Legislative Assembly.
The schedule of the election was announced by the Election Commission of India on 16 August 2024. The ballots were counted and the results were declared on 8 October 2024. Although the majority of exit polls predicted a landslide victory for the Indian National Congress-led alliance, the Bharatiya Janata Party won a majority with 48 seats and secured victory for the third consecutive time, becoming the first party in the state's history to achieve this feat. Although the popular vote total differed by less than one percentage point, the Congress managed to win only 37 seats.
The tenure of the 14th Haryana Assembly was slated to end on 3 November 2024. In the previous Assembly elections held in October 2019, BJP the emerged as the single largest party and formed a coalition government with Jannayak Janta Party. Before the elections, Nayab Singh Saini of the BJP was the incumbent Chief Minister.

# Background

The tenure of the 14th Haryana Assembly was slated to end on 3 November 2024. The previous Assembly elections were held in October 2019, in which the Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as the single largest party [1]. After the election, the BJP formed a coalition government with the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) with Manohar Lal Khattar becoming the Chief Minister and Dushyant Chautala as his deputy. On 12 March 2024, Khattar resigned as the Chief Minister after the coalition between the BJP and JJP came to an end. Nayab Singh Saini of the BJP was sworn in as the new Chief Minister on the same day with the support of independents [3]. After three independents withdrew their support to the BJP government in May 2024, Saini led a minority government [4]. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections held earlier in the year, the BJP which had held all the seats following the 2019, retained five seats while the Indian National Congress won the remaining five seats. 

# Schedule

The schedule of the election was announced by the Election Commission of India on 16 August 2024. The election was scheduled to be held in a single phase on 1 October [8]. On 31 August, the Election Commission announced that the elections would be held on 5 October and that the votes would be counted on 8 October [9]. 

# Parties and Alliances

The BJP contested in 89 seats. On 12 September, the Congress announced an alliance with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [12]. In July 2024, the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) announced an alliance for the assembly elections, with Abhay Singh Chautala as the chief ministerial face [13] [14]. In August 2024, the JJP announced an alliance with the Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram) (ASP) for the elections [15] [16]. 

# Major issues

## Farmers protest and demands

The three farm laws by the BJP-led central government in 2020 have been a major point of contention with the farmers across various states. The farmers in Haryana  also participated in the protests with the demand for the repeal of these laws, claiming that they adversely affect their crop sales and income was a prominent issue of that time. Another significant issue prior to the elections was the demand for a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers [46]. Farmer unions advocated the government to ensure that MSPs are legally mandated, arguing that it will provide a safety net for their produce and ensure fair prices. The demand arose from concerns that the farmers might face financial instability due to fluctuating market prices without such guarantees. The issue was part of broader discontent with the existent agricultural policies and became a key topic in the electoral debates. 

## Agnipath scheme

The Agnipath Scheme was a tour of duty style scheme introduced by the central government in June 2022, which proposed a four-year term recruitment into the Indian Army, after which 25% of them would continue their service in the army and rest would be dismissed. The scheme was seen as a move away from permanent recruitment and became a contentious issue in Haryana with concerns that it may lead to instability in employment for the soldiers. The state government introduced a quota for such relieved soldiers in certain state government jobs . 

## Unemployment

Unemployment was raised as a significant issue in the state as indicated by a survey by India Today. Opposition parties questioned the effectiveness of government policies in creating job opportunities for the youth, which made it a central debating topic in the elections [51]. 

## Inflation

Rising prices of essential goods and services was also raised as a major election issue by the opposition parties. They claimed that the inflation has significantly impacted the cost of living in Haryana and questioned the government's ability to manage inflation and provide relief to affected citizens [53]. 

## Wrestler protests

Haryana has a longstanding tradition in wrestling and sends the highest number of wrestlers who represent India at major international events. A group of wrestlers have been protesting against the earlier chief of Wrestling Federation of India BJP's Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who had sexual abuse charges filed against him [55]. The wrestlers accused Singh of failing to provide them with safety and demanded justice against the same. For the Khelo India, which aims to promote sports at the grassroots level, the state was allocated only 3% of the total budget, leading to dissatisfaction and criticism from the sports community due to a perceived imbalance in the distribution of resources and support for athletes in the state [56]. 

# Campaigns

# Surveys and polls

The exit polls were released on 5 October 2024 after the polling ended. Most of the exit polls predicted a victory for the Congress. However, in actual result the BJP formed the government. [66]. 

# Results

The BJP achieved its third consecutive victory in Haryana following the vote count for the October 5, 2024, assembly election, held on Tuesday. The party overcame 10 years of anti-incumbency and defied exit polls that had forecasted a decisive win for the opposition Congress. The BJP secured 48 seats in the 90-member assembly, while Indian National Congress, won 37 seats. Three independents and two candidates from the INLD also emerged victorious. 

# Reactions

While the BJP celebrated their victory and hailed the elections as historic, the Congress rejected the Haryana election results, citing irregularities in certain districts and raising concerns about the functioning of EVMs. During a press conference, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera declared that the party would not fully accept the outcome,   though senior state leaders have conceded [79] [80]. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh suggested that in constituencies where more EVMs which were found to have high battery levels (99%) during the counting process, the BJP had won while in those with lower levels, the Congress won; EVM batteries last the full election cycle. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has denied that it had received complaints about EVM batteries from candidates or polling agents during the process. The ECI also dismissed earlier complaints from the Congress about a slowdown in result updates as ill-founded. Several leaders and political parties have raised concerns about EVM manipulation over the preceeding years, while the ECI has consistently maintained that EVMs cannot be manipulated. In April 2024, the Supreme Court had rejected a plea which sought either a return to paper ballots or 100% VVPAT slip counting. The BJP alleges that the opposition makes these accusations when they face defeat [82] [84].
