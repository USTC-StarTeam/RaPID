Second_cabinet_of_Donald_Trump

Donald Trump assumed office as the 47th president of the United States on January 20, 2025.
The president has the authority to nominate members of his cabinet to the United States Senate for confirmation under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution.

# Cabinet

All permanent members of the Cabinet of the United States as heads of executive departments require the advice and consent of the United States Senate following appointment by the president before taking office. The vice presidency is exceptional in that the position requires an election to office pursuant to the United States Constitution. The president may also designate heads of other agencies and non-Senate-confirmed members of the Executive Office of the President as Cabinet-level members of the Cabinet. The Cabinet meets with the president in the Cabinet Room, a room adjacent to the Oval Office.. As the Republican Party will control the next Senate, it is expected that all of Trump's designates will be confirmed with little contest. However, some nominees have been met with criticism by a few Senate Republicans [1]. On November 12, 2024, president-elect Trump announced that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would work together to lead the Department of Government Efficiency in his second term. Despite the name, it is unlikely to be a federal executive department, since official departments require congressional approval, and is more likely to be a component of the Executive Office of the President or a presidential commission working closely with the Office of Management and Budget [3]. Trump's cabinet choices were described by news media as valuing personal loyalty over relevant experience,   and for having a range of conflicting ideologies and "eclectic personalities" [6] [7]. It was also described as the wealthiest administration in modern history, with over 13 billionaires chosen to take government posts [8] [9]. Trump officials and Elon Musk threatened to fund primary challengers in upcoming elections against Republican Senators who did not vote for Trump's nominees [10] [11]. The following have been named as Cabinet appointees by the President of the United States.. 

## Confirmation process

Below is a list of confirmations for or withdrawals from Cabinet positions, Cabinet-level positions, and other significant positions that were approved through the Senate from January 2025 onwards, by a recorded roll-call vote, rather than by a voice vote. Withdrawals are color coded gray. For example, Matt Gaetz had withdrawn his nomination at the beginning of the confirmation process.. 

# Elected officials

## President

Donald Trump defeated the incumbent vice president and Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential election, receiving 312 electoral votes compared to Harris's 226 electoral votes in the election; winning every swing state in addition to holding on to all of the states that he won in 2020. The formal certification of the results took place on January 6, 2025 [14] [15]. He assumed office on January 20, 2025.. 

## Vice President

The vice president is the only cabinet member to be elected to the position who does not require Senate confirmation, and the vice president does not serve at the pleasure of the president. There were dozens of potential running mates for Trump who received media speculation. Trump's eventual pick of Senator JD Vance (R-OH) was officially announced on July 15, 2024, and confirmed by acclamation via parliamentary procedure amongst delegates to the 2024 Republican National Convention on July 15, 2024.. United States senator JD Vance (R-OH) was elected Vice President of the United States, receiving 312 electoral votes, compared to the governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, who received 226 electoral votes in the election. The formal certification of the results took place on January 6, 2025. He assumed office on January 20, 2025. Vance is the third youngest vice president in U.S. history..

It was previously a Cabinet-level member during the Clinton administration [63]. The president-elect nominated former senator Kelly Loeffler from Georgia to be Administrator of the Small Business Administration on December 4, 2024. [64] [65]. 

## White House chief of staff

The White House chief of staff has traditionally been the highest-ranking staff employee of the White House. The responsibilities of the chief of staff are both managerial and advisory over the president's official business. The chief of staff is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the president; it does not require Senate confirmation. On November 7, 2024, Trump announced Susie Wiles from Florida as his choice for his chief of staff, having served as his 2024 campaign co-chair. Wiles is the first woman to hold the position. 

# Acting Cabinet officials

Because cabinet members must be confirmed by the Senate, acting officials are typically appointed for the period before the Senate votes, in accordance with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. For cabinet positions, only people who already actively hold a position confirmed by the Senate at the end of the previous administration are eligible. Normally, a senior employee of the same executive agency who is equivalent to a GS-15 or above on the federal pay scale would also be eligible, but this is believed to be unconstitutional in the case of secretaries of the federal executive departments, although this has not been tested in court [68].
