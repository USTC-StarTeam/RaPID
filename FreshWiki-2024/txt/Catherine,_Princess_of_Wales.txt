# Early life and education

Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born on 9 January 1982 at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading into an upper-middle-class family with ties to the landed gentry. Her parents, Michael Middleton  and Carole (née Goldsmith),  were a flight dispatcher and flight attendant at British Airways, respectively [8]. She was baptised at St Andrew's Bradfield, a local parish church, on 20 June 1982. She has two younger siblings, Philippa ("Pippa") and James [10] [11]. Her paternal family benefited financially from trust funds; her great-grandparents Noël and Olive Middleton played host to members of the British royal family in the 1920s through to the 1940s [13]. Her maternal family are descended from coal miners and have been described as working-class [375]. Middleton's family moved from Bradfield Southend, Berkshire, to Amman, Jordan, in May 1984, where Catherine attended an English-language nursery school. When her family returned to Berkshire in September 1986, she was enrolled aged four at St Andrew's School, a private school near Pangbourne in Berkshire [20] [21].

## Relationship with Prince William

In 2001 Middleton met Prince William while they were students in residence at St Salvator's Hall at the University of St Andrews. [b] She reportedly caught William's eye at a charity fashion show at the university in 2002 when she appeared on the stage wearing a see-through lace dress [42]. The couple began dating in 2003 [43]. During their second year, Middleton shared a flat with William and two other friends . From 2003 until 2005, they both resided at Balgove House on the Strathtyrum estate with two roommates [45]. In 2004 the couple briefly split but later rekindled their relationship [46]. After her graduation, Middleton and her family faced intensive tabloid press scrutiny due to her relationship with William. In November 2006, she commenced part-time work for twelve months as an accessories buyer with the clothing chain Jigsaw [48]. She also worked as a project manager in the family business, where she was responsible for the website and catalogue [49] [50]. Middleton attended William's Passing Out Parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in December 2006. In April 2007, they ended their relationship [53] [54]. It was subsequently reported that the couple had reconciled [55] [56]. In May 2008, Middleton attended the wedding of William's cousin Peter Phillips to Autumn Kelly in place of William, and met Queen Elizabeth II for the first time [57]. Middleton also attended the Order of the Garter procession at Windsor Castle in June 2008, where William was made a Royal Knight of the Garter. In July 2008, she was a guest at the wedding of Lady Rose Windsor and George Gilman while William was away on military operations in the Caribbean, serving aboard HMS Iron Duke [60]. In June 2010, the couple moved into a cottage on the Bodorgan Estate in Anglesey, Wales, where William resided during his RAF search and rescue training and subsequent career [61]. Before her marriage, Middleton lived with her sister Pippa in an apartment owned by their parents in Chelsea, London [62] [63]. 

## Marriage and children

Middleton and William became engaged in October 2010, at a remote alpine cabin on Mount Kenya  during a ten-day trip to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to celebrate the prince's passing the RAF helicopter search and rescue course [65]. Clarence House announced the engagement on 16 November that year [66] [67]. William gave her the engagement ring that had belonged to his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales [68] [69]. Middleton was confirmed into the Church of England on 10 March at St James's Palace by the Bishop of London, with her family and William in attendance, preceding her wedding. The couple married on 29 April 2011 at Westminster Abbey on St Catherine's Day. The day was declared a bank holiday in the United Kingdom [72]. Estimates of the global audience for the wedding ranged around 300 million or more, whilst 26 million watched the event live in Britain alone [72]. Her wedding dress was designed by Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen [73] [74] [75]. Catherine was styled as "Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge" [76]. The couple were given the country home Anmer Hall, on the Sandringham House, as a wedding gift from the Queen [77].

She gave birth to Prince George at St Mary's Hospital, London, in July 2013 [83]. The severe morning sickness returned with the subsequent pregnancies, forcing Catherine to cancel her official engagements [84]. She gave birth to Princess Charlotte in May 2015  and to Prince Louis in April 2018 [85] [86]. George, Charlotte and Louis were respectively third, fourth and fifth in the line of succession to the British throne at the times of their births [87] [88].

Kensington Palace announced in January 2024 that Catherine had undergone a planned abdominal surgery for an undisclosed medical condition at the London Clinic. She postponed all of her public engagements and duties through March that year [92] [93]. The subsequent speculation about her absence from public view prompted various conspiracy theories about her health and garnered extensive media attention [94]. The speculation largely started after William withdrew from the thanksgiving service of his godfather, Constantine II of Greece, where he was slated to speak, citing an undisclosed "personal matter" [95] [96]. Catherine announced on 22 March, through a video message filmed by BBC Studios, that post-operative tests had found cancer, and the palace said she had been undergoing chemotherapy since late February. Her medical leave from public engagements was subsequently extended [98] [99]. She made her first public appearance after her cancer diagnosis at the 2024 Trooping the Colour in June, having mentioned in a letter released by Kensington Palace the previous day that she was still undergoing treatment for cancer [100].

Rhonda Garelick of The New York Times has also noted her ability to balance modernity with traditional royal norms [297] [298]. Speaking to The Times on Catherine's 40th birthday, her aides stated that she does not accept "advice on a PR basis" and will "never do something because she thinks the media will like it."  Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, her and William's former private secretary, stated that "she has that almost old-fashioned, Queen Mother attitude to drama – she just doesn't do it." [299] [300] [300]. Time magazine listed Catherine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2013. In 2011 and 2024, she was one of the runners-up for the magazine's Person of the Year award [301]. In 2023 and 2024, The Independent included Catherine on its "Influence List" [302] [303]. In December 2022, she was found to be the second most liked member of the royal family by statistics and polling company YouGov,  while an Ipsos favourability poll in April 2023 suggested that she was the most liked member [304] [305] [306]. In April 2024, YouGov found her to be the most popular member of the royal family [307]. In 2024 Catherine was found to be the most searched person on Google Search in the United Kingdom and the second most searched person globally [308]. 

# Privacy and the media

The death of Diana, Princess of Wales, while being chased by paparazzi in August 1997  has influenced Catherine's and William's attitude towards the media [311]. They have often requested that, when off-duty, their privacy should be respected [312]. In April 2004, The Sun published pictures of Middleton with William at a ski resort and alleged that she was his girlfriend. After her graduation from university, Middleton was faced with widespread press attention and was often photographed by the paparazzi [313]. In October 2005, she complained through her lawyer about harassment from the media, stating she had done nothing significant to warrant publicity and complained that photographers were permanently stationed outside her flat [48]. Dickie Arbiter, who previously served as a press secretary to the royal family, stated that her treatment by the press drew parallels to the tumultuous experience of Diana in the early years of her marriage [314] [315]. Between 2005 and 2006, Middleton's phone was hacked 155 times according to former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman, who was involved in a phone hacking scandal by the newspaper that targeted the royal family [316]. In 2005, after Middleton was chased by the paparazzi on her way to an interview, William consulted her and her father and penned a legal letter to newspapers requesting that they respect her privacy [317]. In April 2006, her lawyers issued new warnings to several newspapers and picture agencies after they published photographs of Middleton on a bus during a shopping trip [318]. Media attention increased around the time of Middleton's 25th birthday in January 2007, prompting warnings from Prince Charles, Prince William, and Middleton's lawyers, who threatened legal action. Two newspaper groups decided to refrain from publishing paparazzi pictures of Middleton but continued to use photographs of her at public events [320] [314] [321]. In March 2007, her lawyers filed a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) over a photograph published by the Daily Mirror that was taken as a result of harassment, leading to a settlement and a warning from the PCC [322] [323]. In July 2007, MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee stated that Middleton was the victim of "clear and persistent harassment" by the paparazzi and criticised the lack of intervention by the PCC [324] [325]. In 2010 Middleton pursued an invasion of privacy claim against two agencies and photographer Niraj Tanna for photographs taken of her playing tennis over Christmas 2009, resulting in £5,000 damages, legal costs, and an apology. In 2011 close associates of Jonathan Rees, a private investigator connected to the News International phone hacking scandal, stated that he had targeted Catherine during her period as William's girlfriend [327] [328] [329] [330]. In May 2011, the Middleton family complained to the PCC after photographs of Catherine, Pippa, and their mother in bikinis while on holiday in 2006 were published in several newspapers. One of the photographs showed Pippa topless, prompting the family to complain about newspapers breaching the editors' code of practice by invading their privacy [332]. In September 2011, a deal was negotiated for the images to be removed from the newspapers' websites and never published again [332]. In September 2012, the French edition of Closer and the Italian gossip magazine Chi published photographs of Catherine sunbathing topless while on holiday at the Château d'Autet. On 17 September 2012, William and Catherine filed a criminal complaint with the French prosecution department and launched a claim for civil damages at the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Nanterre [334]. The following day the courts granted an injunction against Closer, prohibiting further publication of the photographs and announced a criminal investigation would be initiated [335]. In September 2017, Closer was fined €100,000 and its editor Laurence Pieau and owner Ernesto Mauri were each fined €45,000 [336]. In December 2012, two Australian radio hosts, Michael Christian and Mel Greig, called King Edward VII's Hospital where Catherine was an in-patient for hyperemesis gravidarum. Pretending to be Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles, Greig and Christian spoke to a nurse on Catherine's ward, enquiring about her condition. Following a hospital inquiry and a public backlash against the hoax, Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who put the call through to the ward, died by suicide. The radio hosts subsequently apologised for their actions [338]. In February 2013, Chi published the first photos of Catherine's exposed pregnant belly, taken during her vacation on the private island of Mustique which the British press refused to publish. In October 2014, Catherine and William sent a legal letter to a freelance photographer who had put their son George and his nanny "under surveillance", asking the individual to stop "harassing and following" them [340]. In August 2015, Kensington Palace published a letter detailing what it stated were the "dangerous" and invasive efforts of the media to get paparazzi pictures of Prince George and Princess Charlotte [341]. In March 2019, the royal family introduced new rules for followers commenting on its official social media accounts in response to the online abuse aimed at Catherine and her sister-in-law Meghan. In May 2020, Kensington Palace said that the cover story of Tatler magazine titled "Catherine the Great" contained "a swathe of inaccuracies and false misrepresentations" [343]. In September 2020, after pressure from the couple's lawyers, the magazine removed remarks on Catherine's family and other similar claims from the online version of the story [344]. In early March 2024, the Associated Press, AFP, Reuters and Getty Images withdrew from publishing a Mother's Day photograph of Catherine and her children. The photograph was attributed to William and accompanied by a personal message from her. The Associated Press explained it retracted the photograph because of concerns regarding digital alteration of the image at its source [346]. AFP and Reuters raised similar concerns [347]. The following day, in a message posted by Kensington Palace, Catherine apologised for any confusion created and said she had personally edited the family photograph that was shared publicly [348] [349]. The incident occurred after she had begun chemotherapy treatment for cancer, which she announced on 22 March [350] [351]. In the same month, the London Clinic initiated an investigation into a potential breach of privacy law after up to three staff members were found attempting to access Catherine's private medical records following her discharge from the hospital [352]. 

# Titles, styles, honours and arms

## Titles and styles

Upon her marriage in April 2011, Catherine became a princess of the United Kingdom, as well as Duchess of Cambridge, Countess of Strathearn, and Baroness Carrickfergus; she also received the style of Royal Highness. She was formally known as "Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge" except in Scotland, where she was instead called "Her Royal Highness the Countess of Strathearn" [355] [356]. Queen Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022, and Catherine's father-in-law succeeded as Charles III. Catherine became Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Rothesay [358]. Thus, she was briefly referred to by the title "Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge" [359] [360]. The following day, on 9 September 2022, the King announced William's appointment as Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, thereby making Catherine Princess of Wales and Countess of Chester [361]. She has since been known as "Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales", and as "Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Rothesay" in Scotland. 

## Honours

Catherine is a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO),  a Royal Companion of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH),  and a recipient of the Royal Family Order of Queen Elizabeth II [364] [365]. 

# Ancestry

Catherine's father, Michael, is the son of Captain Peter Francis Middleton, who, along with their Middleton forebears, were from Leeds, West Yorkshire. The historian Robert Lacey describes Michael Middleton as  having aristocratic kinship; his grandmother, Olive Christiana  Middleton, was close to her second cousin  Baroness Airedale (1868–1942) [367]. Both Catherine's paternal great-grandmother Olive Middleton (née Lupton) and her first-cousin-once-removed Baroness von Schunck (née Kate Lupton) grew up at Potternewton Hall Estate, the seat of the Lupton family, who are described as landed gentry and, as such, were invited to the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary in 1911 [368] [369]. Four successive generations of Catherine's ancestors had lived at Potternewton Hall Estate: Catherine's great-grandmother Olive Middleton; her father, politician Francis Martineau Lupton; his mother, educator Frances Elizabeth Lupton; and her father, epidemiologist and surgeon Thomas Michael Greenhow [371] [372]. Catherine's maternal ancestors, the Harrisons, were working-class labourers and miners from Sunderland and County Durham. Ancestors through her maternal line include Sir Thomas Conyers, 9th Baronet, who was a descendant of Edward IV through his illegitimate daughter Elizabeth Plantagenet [376]. Other paternal ancestors include Sir Thomas Fairfax and his wife Anne Gascoigne, who was a descendant of Edward III [377].
