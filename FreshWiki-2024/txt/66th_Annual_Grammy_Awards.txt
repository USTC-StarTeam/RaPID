66th_Annual_Grammy_Awards

The 66th Annual Grammy Awards honored the best recordings, compositions, and artists from October 1, 2022, to September 15, 2023, as chosen by the members of The Recording Academy, on February 4, 2024. In its 21st year at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, the ceremony was broadcast on CBS and available to stream on Paramount+, and was hosted by Trevor Noah for the fourth time.
The nominations were announced on November 10, 2023; SZA received the most nominations with nine, followed by Victoria Monét, Phoebe Bridgers (solo and as part of boygenius), and Serban Ghenea with seven each. Monét's 2-year-old daughter, Hazel, became the youngest nominee in Grammy Awards history; she was a featured artist on her mother's song "Hollywood", which was nominated for Best Traditional R&B Performance.
Bridgers was the night's biggest winner, receiving four awards: Three as part of Boygenius (Best Rock Song, Best Rock Performance, and Best Alternative Music Album), and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance alongside SZA. SZA, Monét, and Killer Mike received three awards each. Taylor Swift made history as the first singer to win Album of the Year four times, and engineer Serban Ghenea extended his record with a fifth award in the category as well. South African singer Tyla was the winner of the inaugural Best African Performance award.
In the big four categories, Swift's Midnights won the aforementioned Album of the Year prize; Miley Cyrus's "Flowers" won Record of the Year; Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas won Song of the Year for "What Was I Made For?" (from the soundtrack of Barbie); and Victoria Monét took home Best New Artist.

# Background

For the 2024 ceremony, the academy announced several changes for different categories, the introduction of new categories, and updates on eligibility rules: [7] [8] [9]. 

## Field changes

The Grammy ballot was reduced from 26 fields to 11, not including the General Field. The Recording Academy stated that this was done to ensure that all voting members were able to exercise all 10 of their allocated votes, as this was prevented when some fields only contained one category. In addition to their votes in the General Field, voters are encouraged to cast up to ten genre category votes spread across a maximum of three fields. As of the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, the fields are listed as follows:. 

## Artificial intelligence ineligibility

On June 16, 2023, in response to the rapidly developing field of artificial intelligence (AI), the Recording Academy declared that "only human creators are eligible to be submitted for consideration for, nominated for, or win a Grammy Award. A work that contains no human authorship is not eligible in any categories." The organization further specified that works featuring AI-generated material are eligible for an award only if a human contributed to the work meaningfully in the creation process and that contributors of only AI-generated material are not eligible for an award. This controversy was cleared up when the song "Heart on My Sleeve" by ghostwriter977, which uses AI voice cloning to mimic the vocals of Drake and The Weeknd, was submitted for Grammy consideration [10] [11]. While the song was written by a human, it was deemed ineligible due to its AI vocals, illegal usage of those vocals without clearance by either artists' record labels, and lack of commercial availability. 

# Performers

The second batch of performers, consisting of Travis Scott, Luke Combs and Burna Boy, were announced on January 21 [13].
