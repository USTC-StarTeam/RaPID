Strictly_Come_Dancing_series_22

Strictly Come Dancing returned for its twenty-second series with a launch show on 14 September 2024 on BBC One, with the live shows beginning on 21 September. A special episode to commemorate the programme's twentieth anniversary has also been confirmed. Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman returned as hosts, whilst Janette Manrara and Fleur East returned to host Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two. Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas and Anton Du Beke returned to the judging panel.
Comedian Chris McCausland and his partner Dianne Buswell were announced as the winners on 14 December.

# Format

The couples dance each week in a live show. The judges score each performance out of ten. After all the couples have danced they are then ranked according to the judges' scores and given points according to their rank, with the highest ranked couple receiving a number of points equal to the number of couples dancing that week e.g. 7 points where there are seven couples dancing. When there are no tied scores the lowest scored couple will receive one point. However in the event of a tie where two or more couples obtain the same judges score, the couple below those in the tie will be awarded one point below the points awarded to each of the tied couples. So, for example, if two couples obtain the same rank and obtain 7 points each, the couple immediately below them will be awarded 6 points. When couples are ranked equally by the judges the scoring of all other couples underneath will follow in the same descending order. Should there be any tied scores the lowest scored couple will therefore receive more than one point from the judges scores. The public are also invited to vote for their favourite couples, and the couples are ranked again according to the number of votes they receive, again receiving points; The couple with the most votes receiving the most points. Again in the unlikely  event of a tie in the public vote the points are awarded in the same way as the points from the judges score.. The points for judges' score and public vote are then added together, and the two couples with the fewest points are placed in the bottom two. If two couples have equal points, the points from the public vote are given precedence. As with the previous series, the bottom two couples have to perform a dance-off on the results show. Based on that performance alone, each judge then votes on which couple should stay and which couple should leave, with Shirley Ballas, as head judge, having the last and deciding vote, if needed.. 

# Professional dancers

In June 2024, the BBC announced that Dianne Buswell, Nadiya Bychkova, Vito Coppola, Graziano Di Prima, Amy Dowden, Carlos Gu, Karen Hauer, Katya Jones, Neil Jones, Nikita Kuzmin, Gorka Márquez, Luba Mushtuk, Lauren Oakley, Jowita Przystał, Johannes Radebe, Michelle Tsiakkas, Kai Widdrington and Nancy Xu would be returning to the series. It was confirmed that Giovanni Pernice would not be returning to the show, following misconduct allegations regarding his dance teaching methods [8]. Pernice, however, denied "any suggestion of abusive or threatening behaviour" [9] [10] [11]. In July 2024, it was announced that Aljaž Škorjanec would be returning as a professional after a two-year hiatus, following his departure in March 2022, having last appeared in the nineteenth series. Later that same month, despite initially being confirmed to return for the series, it was subsequently announced that Graziano Di Prima would not be returning to the show, following allegations of misconduct against him towards Zara McDermott, his partner from the previous series [13] [14]. In a statement, Di Prima said that he "deeply regretted" the events that led to his departure from the show [15]. During the launch show, Michelle Tsiakkas received a celebrity partner for the first time, while Carlos Gu, Lauren Oakley and Kai Widdrington did not receive a partner. The rest of the pros were paired to a celebrity, including Neil Jones, who did not have a celebrity partner for the last two series. On 4 November 2024, it was announced that due to a foot injury, professional dancer Amy Dowden will no longer compete in the remainder of the series. With Lauren Oakley stepping in to dance with contestant JB Gill, this led to Oakley receiving a partner for the rest of the series. 

# Couples

On 1 August 2024, prior to the official BBC announcements, Tom Dean confirmed himself as the first participant in the series, during an interview at the 2024 Summer Olympics after competing in the 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay. The official announcements began on 5 August, with Chris McCausland and JB Gill announced respectively, the former of which became the first blind contestant to appear on the show [21]. Celebrity contestants continued to be revealed until 12 August 2024, when the full line-up was announced [22].
