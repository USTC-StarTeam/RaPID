# Early life

Yaroslava Mahuchikh was born on 19 September 2001 in Dnipropetrovsk (now - Dnipro)  to Olha and Oleksiy Mahuchikh [1]. Her father Olekiy was a canoeist and mother Olha was a gymnast and did athletics. Older sister Anastasia Hryhorovich was into karate and athletics and represented Ukraine in karate competitively. Mahuchikh began doing sports at the age of seven  following her sister's lead [12]. Karate became young Mahuchikh's first sport when she accompanied her sister to her karate classes. But Mahuchikh didn't like karate and gave up after a few tries [13]. To help channel the tireless energy of young Mahuchikh to good use, her sister brought her to the local sports club, where she trained, to try athletics next. Young Mahuchikh began to train under her sister's coach Olena Kutsenko where what started off as play classes gradually turned into full-fledged training. Prior to focusing on high jump, Mahuchikh started out competing as a sprinter, hurdler and long jumper,  until her current coach Tetiana Stepanova came to the sports club in Dnipro when Mahuchikh was 11 [14] [13]. At first, Kutsenko and Stepanova coached Mahuchikh together, but later at the age of 13, Mahuchikh came under the tutelage of Tetiana Stepanova after the coaches parted ways. Under Stepanova's guidance, Mahuchikh deepened her love for sports and found her niche in high jump progressing rapidly in the next few years. Aside from athletics, Mahuchikh attended singing and art lessons when she was little. She grew to like drawing and painting and participated in art contests until about 2015 - 2016. She dreamed of becoming an artist or singer but that changed after she started with track and field [16] [17]. She went on later to enrol in Dnipro Higher School of Physical Education to pursue her new aspirarion to become a coach [18].

After the final of the high jump event, Time, The New York Times and other media outlets wrote about her routine of resting in a sleeping bag during jump breaks, which aided her in winning gold medal at this Summer Olympics, and all of her sudden she became a hero of memes [107]. After the victory at the 2024 Olympics, a song was created about Yaroslava Mahuchikh [108] [109] [110]. On 22 August, Mahuchikh marked her debut as Olympic champion winning the Diamond League stage Athletissima in Lausanne by jumping 1.99 m.

# Controversy with Lasitskene

After the final event at the 2020 Summer Olympics, Mahuchikh congratulated Russian high jumper and Olympic champion Mariya Lasitskene for her win and hugged her. Her gesture of sportmanship however evoked a wave of nationalistic feelings among Ukrainians and caused a controversy because of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War and the fact that both athletes were honorary members of their respective country's armed forces [134]. Lasitskene held the rank of captain in the Russian Armed Forces while Mahuchikh was a junior lieutenant in the Armed Forces of Ukraine: their military ranks were awarded to them because of their outstanding athletic achievements. Ukrainian karateka Stanislav Horuna, who won bronze in the men's under 75 kg kumite karate category, took to Facebook to express his support for Mahuchikh [135]. Mahuchikh herself explained that the photo with Lasitskene had no political intent [136] [137]. In September 2021, after the Diamond League Final, there was a new controversy because of another picture with Lasitskene, who had won the Diamond League Final. This photo was published by Australian high jumper Nicola Olyslagers in Instagram [138]. After the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Mahuchikh said that she regretted the photo with Lasitskene during the 2020 Summer Olympics and that Lasitskene wasn't her idol anymore. 

# Contributions to Ukraine's war effort

## Opposition to Russian athletes competing internationally

On 1 March 2022, in the wake of Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Athletics banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international track and field competitions for the foreseeable future. At the 2022 World Athletics Indoor Championships in mid-March 2022, Mahuchikh condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine [141]. In July 2022, during the 2022 World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, Mahuchikh voiced support when World Athletics reaffirmed its decision to exclude Russian athletes from Oregon22 [142]. The International Olympic Committee had earlier recommended international federations to exclude Russia and Belarus from hosting and competing in the wake of the Russian invasion. In June 2023, at the Lausanne diamond league, after the IOC made a partial change of decision in March 2023 recommending international federations to allow the gradual return of neutral Russian athletes - those evaluated to have no military links - back to international competitions, Mahuchikh publicly criticised president of the IOC Thomas Bach arguing defending Russian athletes citing discrimination is unacceptable when Ukraine's situation remained unchanged and many of her country's athletes were still deprived of a safe and proper training facility. She insisted Russians should be excluded from 2024 Paris Olympics. But IOC's decision in March 2023 held off on deciding whether Russian and Belarusian athletes could compete at next year's Summer Olympics until an appropriate time. In February 2024, after IOC announced in December 2023 that athletes from Russia and Belarus will be allowed to take part as individual neutral athletes in 2024 Paris Olympics, so long as they meet certain eligibility criteria, Mahuchikh expressed disappointment saying that it would be difficult for her to compete against athletes from those countries as they would remind her of the destruction of the cities and lives in Ukraine brought about by Russian people. However, IOC's announcement did not change World Athletic's stance. For the sport of track and field, athletes from Russia and Belarus continued to be excluded from the Paris Summer Games according to its governing body. In June 2024, during the European Championships, Mahuchikh shared that she has spoken to international media to no avail against non-neutral former Russian athletes competing internationally under the citizenship of another country in some sports such as Elena Kulichenko, an ex-Russian high jumper who competed for Cyprus internationally since 2023 after obtaining Cypriot citizenship in 2019. The Cypriot high jumper was chosen as one of the flagbearer for Cyprus at the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics and slated to meet Mahuchikh in the high jump event at the Summer Games. 

## Assisting Ukraine's war needs

In November 2023, Mahuchikh supported the Ukrainian art project "Stolen art", established by United24 and the Oliz brand to draw attention to the destruction of Ukrainian culture. In August 2024, after her win at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Mahuchikh transferred a portion of her prize money to animal rights groups and military needs in her country. She donated 1 million hryvnas to animal rescue organisation Uanimals and four shelters: Sumy Society for the Protection of Animals,  "Pegas" in Dnipro, "Homeless World" and "Dnipro Animals Foundation" [152]. She also donated 500 thousand hryvnas to the military's Azov's Angels Patronage Service and another 500 thousand hryvnas to the Hospitallers to fund the treatment and recovery of wounded soldiers with head injuries [153]. Later, Ukrainian influencer and blogger Ihor Lachenkov in Telegram announced Mahuchikh's donation of 1 million hryvnas to provide vehicles for combat units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the front line [154] [4]. In October 2024, Mahuchikh told Tribuna, a Ukrainian sports publishing house, in an interview that she donated her 2024 Paris Olympics competition bib to the "Heroes Cup" charity auction where it was sold for 300,000 hryvnas (UAH) to help with military rebuilding effort. In the same month, Mahuchikh took part in the 18th Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for Sport, held in Porto, where she made a speech about the Ukrainian sport during the Russian invasion of Ukraine [156]. Later that month, Mahuchikh became an ambassador of the Ukrainian National project "Vriatyi Kintsivky" (Save Limb), dedicated to the rehabilitation of Ukrainian Armed Forces troops [157] [158]. In November 2024, Mahuchikh told to a television host and media personality Masha Efrosynina in an interview that she privately donated to troops of the Ukrainian Armed Forces since the beginning of the Russian invasion in 2022. 

# Personal life

She is currently dating Nazar Stepanov, a Ukrainian hurdler and their national record holder, who is the son of Mahuchikh's coach Tetiana Stepanova. In November 2023, Mahuchikh said in her interview that she was engaged to Nazar [193]. In October 2024, Mahuchikh told Athletistic in an interview that she had to postpone her wedding with Nazar because they wanted to hold their wedding with relatives and friends, then scattered all over the world, gathered in Ukraine, where it was impossible to do so because of the Russian invasion [194]. Mahuchikh picked up the hobby of reading since young. She read Harry Potter books by J. K. Rowling to improve her English. Besides fantasy, she read other genres such as science fiction, romance and crime fiction. Besides novels, she liked books that chronicled successful companies such as Netflix and Starbucks as well as biographies of successful people such as Will Smith and Coco Chanel. One of her favourite reads was Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time by Howard Schultz [196]. Mahuchikh is also an ambassador of Puma and Omega SA.
