This page is subject to the extended confirmed restriction related to the Arab-Israeli conflict.

A 14-month-long conflict between the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israel began on 8 October 2023, when Hezbollah launched rockets and artillery at Israeli positions following the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel. The conflict escalated into a prolonged exchange of bombardments, leading to extensive displacement in Israel and Lebanon. The conflict, part of the broader Middle Eastern crisis that began with Hamas' attack, marked the largest escalation of the Hezbollah–Israel conflict since the 2006 Lebanon War.
On 8 October 2023, Hezbollah started firing guided rockets and artillery shells at Israeli positions in the Shebaa Farms, which it said was in solidarity with Palestinians following the Hamas attack on Israel and beginning of Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip. Israel retaliated by launching drone strikes and artillery shells at Hezbollah positions. Israel also carried out airstrikes throughout Lebanon and in Syria. In northern Israel, the ongoing conflict has forced approximately 96,000 individuals to leave their homes, while in Lebanon, over 1.4 million individuals had been displaced by late October. Hezbollah stated it would not stop attacks against Israel until it stops its military operations in Gaza; Israel said its attacks would continue until its citizens could return safely to the north. 
In September 2024, Israel intensified its operations with two waves of electronic device attacks targeting Hezbollah's communication systems, and later assassinated the group's leading figures, including secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah, and his successor, Hashem Safieddine. 
On 1 October, the Israeli military began an invasion of southern Lebanon, although it had been conducting limited ground operations for some time. Israeli operations led to the significant dismantling of Hezbollah's military infrastructure in southern Lebanon and the destruction of a large portion of its missile stockpile.
A 60-day ceasefire agreement was brokered and took effect on 27 November 2024. The ceasefire required Hezbollah to move its fighters north of the Litani River, approximately 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the Israeli border, while Israel began withdrawing its forces from southern Lebanon. The Lebanese Army was tasked with deploying around 5,000 soldiers to monitor the situation and maintain peace in the region. The ceasefire is being monitored by a panel of five countries, led by the United States, though Israel retains the right to strike at immediate threats in Lebanon during this period.

# Background

## Founding of Hezbollah

Hezbollah is a Lebanese Shiite political party and paramilitary group, formed in 1982 by Muslim clerics with Iranian funding to fight the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. After the war, Israel continued to hold borderland buffer zone in southern Lebanon with the aid of proxy militants in the South Lebanon Army (SLA) [78]. In 2000, Israel withdrew from South Lebanon to the UN-designated and internationally recognized Blue Line border [79]. Hezbollah quickly took control of the area [80]. It has justified its continued existence, occupation, and attacks on Israel by citing both allegations of Lebanese prisoners in Israel and continued Israeli control of the Shebaa farms region, occupied by Israel from Syria in 1967 but considered by Hezbollah to be part of Lebanon. Elimination of the state of Israel has been a primary goal for Hezbollah from its inception. Hezbollah opposes the government and policies of the State of Israel [83] [84] [85]. 

## Palestinian factions in Lebanon

Since the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, Palestinian refugees have had a presence in southern Lebanon as numerous refugee camps were established, which brought many Palestinian factions into south Lebanon, with it being often used as a center to launch rockets into northern Israel. The Palestine Liberation Organization was based in Lebanon after being expelled from Jordan by King Hussein in July 1971. After they were involved in an insurgency in Southern Lebanon, until they were expelled to Tunis after the 1982 Lebanon War [88]. 

## UN Security Council Resolution 1701

A ceasefire was reached between Israel and Hezbollah at the end of the 2006 Lebanon War, based on the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 which called for a demilitarized zone between the southern border of Lebanon and the Litani river. The UN Security Council resolution mandated only the Lebanese army and United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) could be armed in southern Lebanon. It also stated that neither side should cross the Blue Line, which marks the border between Lebanon and the Golan Heights, and divides the village of Ghajar between the two. Despite this, both Israel and Hezbollah have outstanding obligations under UNSCR 1701 [90] [91]. Since 2006, Hezbollah fortified southern Lebanon,  obstructed UNIFIL's access, built tunnels into Israel, and crossed the Blue Line [95]. Israel has also accused Hezbollah of using a local environmental organization as a front for its military activities near the Blue Line [96] [97]. After retreating behind the Blue Line in 2000,   Israel reoccupied the whole of Ghajar in 2006, including the Lebanese part of the village [98] [99] [100] [101]. Israel continues to occupy Ghajar and an adjacent area,   and has repeatedly breached Lebanese airspace, waters, and borders [102] [103] [94] [100]. UNIFIL reports that Israel entered Lebanese airspace on more than 22,000 occasions between 2007 and 2021 [104] [105] [106]. 

## April and July 2023 skirmishes

On 6 April 2023, in response to the 2023 Al-Aqsa clashes, dozens of rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel, injuring three Israeli civilians. The Israel Defense Forces said that it intercepted 25 rockets fired from Lebanon,  which it said were fired by Palestinian factions Hamas and PIJ with Hezbollah's approval [109] [109]. The attacks were the largest escalation between the two countries since the 2006 Lebanon War. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) described the situation as "extremely serious" and urged restraint [110]. On 15 July, the IDF fired warning shots and used riot dispersal munitions on 18 people, including journalists and parliamentarians that crossed the border from Lebanon and walked 80 meters into Israeli-occupied territory. 

## Israel–Hamas war

On 8 October 2023, a day after Hamas launched its 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel and Israel began its bombing of Gaza, Hezbollah joined the conflict in "solidarity with the Palestinians",   initially firing on Israeli military outposts in Shebaa Farms and the Golan Heights — both territories under Israeli occupation [112] [113]. Since then, Hezbollah and Israel have been involved in cross-border military exchanges that have displaced entire communities in Israel and Lebanon, with significant damage to buildings and land along the border [112]. From 7 October 2023 to 20 September 2024, there were 10,200 cross border attacks, of which Israel launched 8,300. Over 96,000 people in Israel  and over 111,000 in Lebanon have been displaced during this period [114] [115]. Israel and Hezbollah have maintained their attacks at a level that causes harm without escalating into a full-scale war [116]. Hezbollah has stated it will continue attacking Israel until Israel halts its operations in Gaza,  where over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed [73]. Israel demanded that Hezbollah implement UNSC 1701 and withdraw its forces north of the Litani River [118] [119]. Diplomatic efforts, led by U.S [93] [120]. envoy Amos Hochstein and France, have so far been unsuccessful in resolving the conflict. In November 2023, Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant warned that Beirut could meet the same fate as Gaza. He made the same warning in January 2024 [123]. In June 2024, Gallant visited the United States, seeking support for an escalation of the war with Hezbollah and a possible ground invasion in Lebanon [124]. 

# Events

## October 2023

### Shebaa farms attack and response

In the morning of 8 October, Hezbollah fired rockets and shells at the Shebaa Farms region in support of Hamas' attack onto Israel; in response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) fired artillery shells and a drone into southern Lebanon. Two Lebanese children were reportedly injured by broken glass [126] [127] [128]. The next day, Israel exchanged a series of airstrikes on southern Lebanon near the towns of Marwahin, Ayta ash Shab  and Dhayra in the Bint Jbeil district [129]. This was after numerous Palestinian militants infiltrated the Israeli border,  which Hezbollah denied involvement with [130] [131]. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad militia claimed responsibility for the armed infiltration. The IDF killed at least two perpetrators (likely Palestinians),  while a third returned to Lebanon [130]. A Hezbollah media source announced three of Hezbollah's members died in the IDF retaliation [132]. Hezbollah fired rockets and artillery in retaliation [133].

The Lebanese-Italian hospital in Tyre admitted three injured civilians [135]. The IDF ordered residents of northern Israel to seek shelter following reports of drones being launched from southern Lebanon [136]. A Patriot missile was launched to intercept a suspicious projectile, after which the IDF found that the object in question was not a drone [137]. Warning sirens were activated across northern Israel after reports emerged that up to 20 infiltrators on paragliders had entered Israeli territory from Lebanon before the IDF dismissed the report as a false alarm [138]. Hezbollah deputy chief Sheikh Naim Qassem said "when time comes for any action, we will carry it out," stating that Hezbollah was ready and would contribute to confrontations against Israel according to its own plan. The IDF fired artillery, into southern Lebanon following an explosion that caused minor damage to a section of the Israel–Lebanon border wall near the kibbutz of Hanita [140].

Reuters photographer Christina Assi was also critically injured [148]. The Lebanese Army has said the IDF fired the missile that killed Abdallah [149] [150]. Another Reuters reporter at the scene said Abdallah was killed by projectiles fired from the direction of Israel. His last post on Instagram, posted a week before he was killed, was a photograph of Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian journalist for Al Jazeera Arabic who had been killed by Israel in 2022 [151]. A February 2024 report by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon concluded that an Israeli tank killed Abdallah when it fired at "clearly identifiable journalists", and that this broke international law. The report "assessed that there was no exchange of fire across the Blue Line at the time of the incident", with no records of any exchange of fire across the border for the 40 minutes before the tank firing. The IDF responded to the report by claiming that Hezbollah attacked them, prompting them to retaliate with tank fire [154]. 

### Further clashes in October

On 16 October, Amnesty International reported that the IDF fired white phosphorus shells into Dhayra, hospitalizing nine civilians and setting fire to civilian objects. Aya Majzoub, Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, described the attack as a violation of international law that needed to be investigated as a war crime, and that it "seriously endangered the lives of civilians, many of whom were hospitalized and displaced, and whose homes and cars caught fire" [155].

## October 2024: invasion of southern Lebanon

On 1 October, the Israeli military began an invasion of southern Lebanon,    also known as the Third Lebanon War by some Israeli sources,  and announced that Israel had been carrying out small covert raids into Lebanon for months [458] [459] [460] [75].

On 27 November, thousands of displaced Lebanese began to return to areas ruined by Israeli strikes [470]. 

# Aftermath

Syrian rebels took advantage of the war, the heavy losses suffered by Hezbollah, and Hezbollah's absence in Syria to launch the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on  27 November 2024 to overrun Syria's government-held territories. Hezbollah, which had previously sent forces, said they would not deploy troops, but later sent "supervising forces" to unsuccessfully attempt to repel the 2024 Homs offensive, as Homs is a key transport route for Iran to supply Hezbollah [473]. 

# Casualties and damage

## Lebanon

On 6 November 2023, in response to the killing of four civilians in southern Lebanon, Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced that his government would submit an urgent complaint to the UN Security Council against Israel saying that its "targeting of civilians in its aggression against Lebanon" was a "heinous crime". Samir Geagea, the leader of a main Christian political party, blamed Hezbollah for attacking Israel and said that it harmed Lebanon while having no impact on Israel's Gaza offensive. 

### Hezbollah

Since 8 October 2023, Hezbollah officially announced the names of 521 members killed during the conflict. After Israel's escalation against Hezbollah in September 2024, Hezbollah mostly stopped announcing its casualties. As of December 2024, the IDF estimates that around 3,800 Hezbollah fighters had been killed since 8 October 2023, including 2,672 during the invasion of Lebanon and 44 since the ceasefire [485]. It earlier estimated that at least 7,000 suffered injuries that made them unable to fight [54]. The Institute for National Security Studies of Tel Aviv University put losses at around 2,450 [55]. According to a source familiar with Hezbollah's operations, the group possibly lost up to 4,000 members during the conflict—over 10 times its losses during the 2006 Lebanon War [486]. Hezbollah's senior leadership faced the heaviest casualties in its entire history during the conflict. According to the IDF, 13 members of Hezbollah's senior command were killed. Its political council lost figures such as Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who ruled the group for over three decades, and his deputy, Hashem Safieddine [54]. Its armed wing lost key leaders such as Fuad Shukr, who commanded Hezbollah's military, Ibrahim Aqil, who was Shukr's deputy, and Ali Karaki, who headed Hezbollah's Southern Front. Hezbollah also saw heavy damage inflicted upon its equipment, missile arsenal and infrastructure in southern Lebanon, weakening its operational capacity [488] [489]. Heavy damage was inflicted upon military infrastructure such as bases, tunnels, weapon depots, and fortifications, and its arms supply has been disrupted by Israeli strikes on Syrian border crossings. According to IDF, they confiscated over 155,000 weapons and pieces of military equipment belonging to Hezbollah, including around 12,000 explosive devices, drones, and other explosive weapons, more than 13,000 anti-tank missile launchers and rockets, and anti-aircraft missiles [76] [489] [490]. In addition, over 121,000 communication devices, computers, electronic equipment and documents were also captured. 

## Israel

Forty-six Israeli civilians,  28 soldiers and one security officer were killed in Hezbollah's attacks on Israel [492]. An additional three soldiers were killed in non-combat incidents; one by malfunctioning ammunition and the other two in a tank accident. Forty-seven soldiers, including a civilian researcher posthumously recognized as a soldier, were killed during combat in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah's attacks resulted in the evacuation of over 90,000 people—60,000 forced and 30,000 voluntary—from northern Israel [60] [493]. As of July 2024, the Israeli government issued orders for the evacuation of 43 settlements located within 3 miles (4.8 km) of the border with Lebanon [494]. At least eight Israeli UAVs were shot down over Lebanon: four Hermes 450 and four Hermes 900 models [495]. According to the Israeli Army Radio, 2,874 buildings have been reported damaged by Hezbollah, including 841 in need of rebuilding. Property damage was estimated to be around ₪1,000,000,000 (US$273,000,000). As of November 2024, over 60% of the buildings in Metula were destroyed by Hezbollah attacks since the start of the conflict. Three-fourths of the buildings in Manara,  382 buildings in Kiryat Shmona, and 55,000 acres of nature in northern Israel and the Golan Heights have been damaged or destroyed by Hezbollah's attacks, while major damage also took place in Nahariya and Shlomi [499] [500]. 

### Economy

According to Tel Aviv University economist Tomer Fadlon, there would be long-term and significant effects on northern Israel's economy if its population did not return. He further said that even if Israel achieved victory in Gaza, the north would possibly not see an economic recovery. The conflict severely hurt the tourism industry in the north, which employs many people [502]. Many factories in the region have not shut down but suffered labor shortages of up to 50%. According to an estimate by the Bank of Israel in November 2023, the Israeli economy suffers the loss of 590 million shekels ($158 million) every week due absence of work caused by the evacuation of 144,000 people after the Israel–Hamas war, 40% of them from the north [494]. Once-robust communities such as Snir and Kiryat Shmona were mostly emptied following the evacuation orders in northern Israel. Kiryat Shmona was planned to be used by food technology businesses, but companies left following the city's evacuation in October 2023. Northern Israel has one-third of Israel's agricultural land, and the occupied Golan Heights and Galilee accounted for 73% of Israel's annual egg production; however, after the outbreak of the conflict, few people remained in the north to tend chicken coops, resulting in a decline in domestic egg production. In August 2024, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security approved a quota for the import of 45 million eggs due to the anticipated drop in local production over the conflict and other reasons [503]. 

# War crimes

## Israeli war crimes

### Killing of Lebanese civilians

In September 2024, thousands of wireless communication devices exploded throughout Lebanon and Syria in an attack attributed to Israel, killing dozens of people, including civilians and Hezbollah militants. Lama Fakih, a director of the Human Rights Watch, said that the explosions would constitute an indiscriminate attack if the IDF had no way of accurately determining the location of the explosive devices since there would be no distinction between civilians and military targets. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said that the attacks violated international human rights since the IDF did not have knowledge regarding the users of the devices or their location and surroundings during the explosions. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human rights, 232 Syrian refugees were killed by the IDF in Lebanon since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. 

### Targeting of journalists

According to the Council of Europe, the intentional targeting of journalists constitutes a war crime. During the conflict, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) claimed that the Israeli army had deliberately targeted journalists [506]. An RSF investigation said that Israel had targeted journalists in two missile strikes on 13 October 2023 that killed Reuters reporter Issam Abdallah and injured four others [507] [508] [509]. These two strikes, 30 seconds apart, hit a group of seven journalists in southern Lebanon who were reporting on the border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. In a video, the journalists are seen wearing vests and helmets identifying them as "PRESS". The marking was also present on the roof of their car, which exploded after being hit by the second missile. The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, which tests and analyses munitions and weapons, assisted Reuters by examining the material collected at the site of the explosion and found that a piece of metal was the fin of a 120 mm tank round fired 1.34 km away from the border from a smoothbore tank gun [510]. 

### IDF's use of white phosphorus

On 31 October 2023, after an investigation, Amnesty International stated that an Israeli white phosphorus attack on 16 October was indiscriminate, unlawful, and "must be investigated as a war crime", due to its use on the populated Lebanese town of Dhayra, which injured at least nine civilians. On 2 November, Amnesty International stated its investigations into four incidents on 10, 11, 16 and 17 October showed Israel had used white phosphorus munitions [511] [156]. The claim was confirmed by the Washington Post, which identified two white phosphorus shell casings made in the U.S [512]. Human Rights Watch verified IDF's use of white phosphorus in at least 17 municipalities in Lebanon, including five municipalities where airburst munitions were used over residential areas [513]. It also called on the Lebanese government to file a declaration to enable investigations in the International Criminal Court [514]. In southern Lebanon, Israel's white phosphorus bombs have destroyed over 4,500 hectares (45,000,000 m2) of forest with economic loses being valued at US$20 million. The American University of Beirut estimated use of white phosphorus has led to more than 134 forest fires as of June 2024 burning 1,500 hectares (15,000,000 m2) of land [515]. As of 28 May 2024, the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health said that exposure to white phosphorus had injured at least 173 people [337]. 

### Targeting of medical and religious sites

The targeting of hospitals, as well as religious sites, constitutes a war crime. Lebanese health minister Firass Abiad said that 163 rescuers and health workers were killed and 273 others were injured in Lebanon since the start of Israel-Hezbollah conflict [516]. Human Rights Watch stated that Israel's "repeated" attacks on medical workers and healthcare facilities were apparent war crimes [517]. The IDF shelled Meiss Ej Jabal Hospital, injuring a doctor on 10 November 2023. The missiles did not explode but caused damage to the emergency department and several cars. Lebanon's Ministry of Public Health condemned the attack, saying that "Israeli authorities were fully responsible for this unjustifiable act, which would have led to catastrophic results", and called for an investigation. Days before, four people were reportedly injured after an Israeli bombing that hit two ambulances [184]. The Lebanese National News Agency said that an Israeli drone strike hit two ambulances belonging to the Risala Scout Association, which is affiliated with the Amal Movement. On 26 December 2023, an anti-tank missile shot by Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon damaged a shed in a church compound in Iqrit, but not the church itself, wounding an elderly civilian. As IDF troops and medical services were working to evacuate him, they were hit by further missiles, which resulted in nine soldiers being wounded, one of them seriously [519]. On 11 January 2024, the IDF conducted strikes in the town of Hanine and targeted an emergency center affiliated with the Hezbollah-linked Islamic Health Authority. The attack killed two workers from the rescue force and destroyed an ambulance. Other attacks on Islamic Health Authority centers occurred in Kafr Kila, Odaisseh and Blida killed seven paramedic and rescue workers and destroyed 17 ambulances [522]. On 27 March 2024, an Israeli airstrike targeted a paramedic center affiliated with the Islamic Group in Hebbariye, killing seven volunteer paramedics. The airstrike was condemned by the Lebanese Ministry of Health. Later in the day, Israeli airstrikes in Tayr Harfa killed two paramedics from the Islamic Health Society, while strikes in Naqoura killed one from the Amal Movement-affiliated Islamic Risala Scout Association [289]. On 7 May 2024, Human Rights Watch declared the 27 March incident as an unlawful attack on civilians and said that they did not find any evidence of military targets at the site that was targeted [291]. Investigations also showed that the IDF used an MPR 500 missile to conduct the raid. On 27 May 2024, an Israeli airstrike near Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil killed three civilians. WHO in Lebanon condemned the attack and called for the protection of hospitals and healthcare workers. In October 2024, the head of Lebanon's Civil Defence in the south said Israel was specifically attacking health workers, stating, "We have had 40 ambulances which have been completely destroyed [525]. On top of that 24 rescuing stations have been hit - just in this area."  Lebanese health officials stated on 5 October 2024 that fifty health officials had been killed in the prior 72 hours [526]. Lebanon's health minister Firas Abiad stated the attacks were war crimes and part of Israel's systematic targeting of Lebanon's healthcare system [527]. A November 2024 investigation found Israel had struck in "lethal proximity" to nineteen different hospitals in Lebanon [528]. 

### Use of booby-trapped devices

Experts warned the 2024 Lebanon pager explosions potentially violated international humanitarian law. Josep Borrell, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, questioned the legality of the pager attacks due to their high collateral damage among civilians, including the deaths of children [530]. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, also raised concerns that the attacks were illegal. Belgian deputy prime minister Petra De Sutter went further, calling it a "terror attack."  Volker Turk, the UN human rights chief, stated, "International humanitarian law prohibits the use of booby-trap devices in the form of apparently harmless portable objects" [531]. Booby traps are mostly outlawed under the Protocol on Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices ("Amended Protocol II") of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons,  to which Israel is a party [531]. Article 7, paragraph 2 of Amended Protocol II prohibits the use of "booby-traps or other devices in the form of apparently harmless portable objects which are specifically designed and constructed to contain explosive material."    The rules of engagement of some countries, such as the United Kingdom, also ban explosive devices disguised as harmless items [533] [531] [533] [534]. The United States Department of Defense Law of War Manual gives watches, cameras, tobacco pipes, and headphones as examples of such items,  which are prohibited to "prevent the production of large quantities of dangerous objects that can be scattered around and are likely to be attractive to civilians, especially children" [535] [533]. On 22 September 2024, Israeli President Isaac Herzog denied any Israeli involvement in the explosions. 

## Hezbollah war crimes

### Killing of Israeli civilians

The elimination of the State of Israel has been a primary goal for Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been accused of "only  [regarding] the Jews living in Israel as Zionists, who should be killed". Throughout the war Hezbollah announced the targeting of civilian homes [537]. On 12 November 2023, Hezbollah fired an anti-tank missile killing an employee of the Israel Electric Corporation who was conducting repair work and injured 13 other Israelis, including six other employees of the Israeli Electric Corporation [538]. The most notable of Hezbollah's attacks on civilians was on 27 July 2024 in the Majdal Shams attack, when Hezbollah fired an Iranian-made Falaq-1 rocket at Majdal Shams, a Druze town in the Golan Heights. The rocket hit a football pitch killing 12 Druze children and injuring at least 42 others. Another attack by Hezbollah resulted in civilian casualties on 9 July 2024, when a rocket struck a couple's car just south of their hometown of Ortal. Additionally, a couple walking their dog in Kiryat Shmona was killed by shrapnel from a Hezbollah rocket on 9 October 2024 [542]. On 26 December 2023, a Hezbollah anti-tank missile impacted near a Channel 13 News team while they were interviewing a farmer at Dovev for an article following a prior Hezbollah assault that killed a 56-year-old employee of the Israel Electric Corporation, and injured five workers who were repairing electric lines. Throughout the conflict, Hezbollah fired thousands of inaccurate munitions at Israel and the Golan Heights, killing and injuring civilians and destroying houses. A December 2024 report by Amnesty International found the use of unguided missiles on civilian areas to likely constitute indiscriminate attacks. International humanitarian law states that parties in a conflict must not direct attacks at civilians and must distinguish civilians and civilian infrastructure from military targets. 

### Accusations of Hezbollah using human shields

There have been claims that Hezbollah has intentionally drawn fire to Christian areas in southern Lebanon. Christians in the town of Rmaich clashed with Hezbollah due to the organization's attempts to establish military infrastructure in the town [546]. The residents also wrote a complaint letter. On 26 March 2024, civilians in Rmaich confronted militants and rang their church bells after Hezbollah attempted to place rocket launchers in the town [546]. Hezbollah denied trying to fire rockets from Rmaich. On 30 November 2024, the IDF said that it killed armed Hezbollah operatives near a church in southern Lebanon [547]. A video appearing to be in the town of Khiyam, showed a tunnel shaft used to store weapons at the church. The Lebanese Kataeb Party criticized Hezbollah for allegedly storing weapons between houses stating that "Hiding weapons between houses does not support Gaza" after an IDF strike on Hezbollah infrastructure in Adloun. Rockets were still exploding about an hour after the strike was reported and the blasts lightly injured three citizens as shrapnel from the explosions flew to surrounding villages. These ammunition depots "open the door to Israeli attacks and turn the Lebanese into human shields", the Kataeb party said. According to IDF's Arabic spokesman, Avichay Adraee, Hezbollah-run yellow ambulances have been used to transport fighters and weapons. The Islamic Health Authority's website says it has "provided services for the activity of the Hezbollah fighters against the Zionist occupation."  According to UNIFIL, Hezbollah has used the environmental NGO "Green Without Borders" to provide direct cover for Hezbollah's military operations by "unlawful construction of military outposts along the Blue Line."  Hezbollah has also launched rockets form UNIFL positions [550] [551]. The IDF reported that 25 rockets were launched from UNIFL positions in October 2024 and said that it discovered hundreds of weapons, including firearms, grenades, and rocket launchers, stored in compounds located near UNIFIL posts in southern Lebanon. After the 20 September 2024 Beirut attack which killed major Redwan Force commanders in the densely populated Dahieh suburbs, Daniel Hagari said that the commanders were holding a meeting "gathered underground under a residential building in the heart of the Dahieh neighbourhood, hiding among Lebanese civilians, using them as human shields." [553]. On 23 September 2024, the IDF began posting pictures and videos of what it claimed was evidence of Hezbollah placing weapons in people's homes. They also released video footage of secondary explosions after targeting buildings which it says are from Hezbollah munitions stored in residential areas [554] [555]. 

# Reactions

## Lebanon

On 6 November 2023, in response to the killing of four civilians in southern Lebanon, Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced that his government would submit an urgent complaint to the UN Security Council against Israel saying that its "targeting of civilians in its aggression against Lebanon" was a "heinous crime". Samir Geagea, the leader of a main Christian political party, blamed Hezbollah for attacking Israel and said that it harmed Lebanon while having no impact on Israel's Gaza offensive. 

### Public opinion

As tensions heightened on 8 October 2023 near the Lebanese border, former prime minister Fouad Siniora stressed that Lebanon should not be involved "in any hostilities with the Israeli enemy". Between 7–9 October 2023, many politicians of long-established Christian parties in Lebanon took a stance against Hezbollah's involvement as well. Pierre Bou Assi, a member of the Lebanese Forces' Strong Republic bloc highlighted the kidnapping of two IDF soldiers which led to the 2006 Lebanon war saying, "Hassan Nasrallah promised, in early July, that the summer would be quiet and thriving—but a few days later, Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers and the July war broke out". The Kataeb Party took a similar stance and condemned the use of Lebanese territory by non-state actors for launching attacks on Israel [560]. [better source needed] [560]. On 4 December 2023, Hamas announced the organization's official establishment in Lebanon. The Lebanon-based unit was named the "al-Aqsa Flood Vanguards unit". The establishment of the Vanguards during the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel faced severe criticism from various political figures and factions within Lebanon [561] [562]. Many argued that such an organization, with potential military implications, could infringe upon Lebanon's sovereignty and violate international resolutions, particularly the Taif Agreement. Critics, including members of the Christian Lebanese Forces Party and other political figures, voiced concerns about a potential recurrence of historical issues related to armed Palestinian factions operating from Lebanese territory. Screens at Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport were hacked allegedly by the Christian group Jnud al-Rab to display an anti-Hezbollah message. Jnud al-Rab denied any involvement. On 28 January 2024, Bechara Boutros al-Rahi, Maronite Patriarch and head of the Maronite Church, stated that residents of southern Lebanon refuse to be used as "sacrificial lambs" in what he described as a "culture of death", implicitly referencing Hezbollah's border activities. He described the hardships faced by the people, including psychological strain and disrupted education for children, and said they refuse to be hostages or human shields. On 24 March 2024, a video showed a nun at a Lebanese Christian school asking students to pray for Hezbollah men defending Lebanon. The video went viral, with some praising the video and others criticizing it. Palestinians in Shatila refugee camp told Al Jazeera that they would fight on the side of Hezbollah and the Axis of Resistance in a war against Israel, but worried for their families and civilians as they feared that Israel would deliberately target densely populated civilian areas. 

## Iraq

On 9 January 2024, the Kata'ib Hezbollah spokesperson Jafar al-Husseini warned that the Islamic Resistance in Iraq would help Hezbollah fight Israel if war erupted between the two sides. This statement was a few weeks after the Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for a drone attack on a Karish rig which Lebanon claims to hold sovereignty to [567]. On 23 June 2024, the spokesperson to Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada Kadhem al-Fartousi said the brigade will join Hezbollah's side if Israel decides to launch a full-blown war in Lebanon [568]. On 24 June 2024, Qais al-Khazali, the leader of Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, stated in a televised speech that if the US continued to support Israel in expanding the war to Lebanon and Hezbollah, the group would begin to attack US interests in Iraq and the Middle East. 

## United States

On 4 November 2023, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken thanked prime minister Najib Mikati during a meeting in Amman "in preventing Lebanon from being pulled into a war that the Lebanese people do not want". United States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin expressed concern about Israel's role in ongoing tensions with Lebanon [572]. On 30 September 2024, the Pentagon said it would be deploying a "few thousand" more troops to the Middle East. On 1 October 2024, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant that the United States supports Israel's ground offensive against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon [574]. The U.S. Embassy in Beirut announced on 27 September 2024 that it was "not evacuating U.S. citizens at this time."  In response, U.S [576]. Representative Rashida Tlaib stated, the State Department was "leaving Americans behind and failing to protect their own citizens". American citizens in Lebanon stated they were being treated like "lesser US citizens" [577]. Lebanese Americans filed a class-action lawsuit against the State Department in the hopes of expediting an evacuation [578]. 

## Other states

French Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu announced that France would donate dozens of armoured vehicles to the Lebanese military to help it carry out patrol missions. Since June 2024, the foreign ministries of Canada,  Kuwait,  Germany, the Netherlands  and North Macedonia  issued statements urging their citizens to leave Lebanon due to fears of an escalation of the conflict [581] [582] [583] [584]. The Canadian Armed Forces said that it was planning to evacuate its 20,000 citizens from Lebanon in the event of an escalation, although it would require support from its allies. On 8 November 2023, two men were arrested by Brazilian police in São Paulo following a warning from Mossad that Hezbollah was planning an attack against the country's Jewish community. Searches were also conducted in Brasília and Minas Gerais in connection with the alleged plot. 

## Economic

As a result of the fighting, Swiss International Air Lines and Lufthansa suspended flights to Beirut, while Lebanon's flag carrier Middle East Airlines relocated five of its 24 aircraft to Istanbul as a precaution. Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom advised against travelling to Lebanon, whilst the British embassy withdrew family members of its staff. 

## Humanitarian response

The Lebanon Humanitarian Fund launched its reserve allocation that includes up to four million US dollars to support its partners to help aid those who have been displaced or still in conflict zones.
