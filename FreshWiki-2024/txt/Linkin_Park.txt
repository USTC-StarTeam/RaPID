# History

## 1996–2000: Foundation and early years

Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson. The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles [7]. After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave "Phoenix" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero [7]. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo album, entitled Xero, released in November 1997. That same month, the band performed their first show, opening for SX-10 and System of a Down at the Whisky a Go Go, a nightclub in West Hollywood [7]. Delson introduced the band to Jeff Blue, the vice president of A&R for Zomba Music, whom he had interned for in college [22]. Blue offered the band constructive criticism to catch the attention of record labels [9]. Blue himself was impressed with Xero after watching them play a live show in 1998 but believed the band needed a different vocalist. Tensions and frustration within the band grew after they failed to land a record deal [9]. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects [7]. Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band [7]. After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue in March 1999. Bennington, formerly of alternative rock band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style [12] [13]. The band then agreed on changing their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material [7]. Additionally, the band recruited bassist Kyle Christner on a temporary basis [7] [14]. In May 1999, the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online "street team" [15]. In October 1999, Christner was replaced by Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck, whom along with Delson, provided bass tracks for the band's recordings [16]. The band still struggled to sign a record deal. They turned to Jeff Blue for additional help after facing numerous rejections from several major record labels. After failing to catch Warner Bros [12]. Records on three previous reviews, Blue, who was now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company as a developing artist in 1999. However, the label advised the band to change their name to avoid confusion with Hybrid [18] [19]. The band considered the names "Plear" and "Platinum Lotus Foundation" before deciding on "Linkin Park",  a play on and homage to Santa Monica's Lincoln Park,  now called Christine Emerson Reed Park [20] [21] [22] [7]. They initially wanted to use the name "Lincoln Park"; however, they changed it to "Linkin" to acquire the internet domain "linkinpark.com" [23]. Bennington and Shinoda both reported that Warner Bros. Records was skeptical of Linkin Park's initial recordings. The label's A&R was not pleased with the band's hip-hop and rock-style approach [26]. An A&R representative suggested that Bennington should demote or fire Shinoda and exclusively focus on making a rock record [26]. Bennington supported Shinoda and refused to compromise Linkin Park's vision for the album [26]. Farrell returned in late 2000, and the band released their breakthrough album, Hybrid Theory, that same year [26].

## 2017–2023: Hiatus and reissues

Linkin Park went on hiatus following Bennington's death. On January 28, 2018, Shinoda replied to a tweet from a fan inquiring about his future with Linkin Park, writing, "I have every intention on continuing with LP, and the guys feel the same. We have a lot of rebuilding to do, and questions to answer, so it'll take time."  On March 29, however, Shinoda stated that he was uncertain of Linkin Park's future when being interviewed by Vulture [222]. On April 17, Linkin Park was nominated for three awards at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards but did not win any of them [223]. The band was presented with The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA on May 18 [224]. On February 18, 2019, Shinoda said in an interview that the band is open to the idea of continuing though what form that takes has yet to be decided [225]. Shinoda stated "I know the other guys, they love to be onstage, they love to be in a studio, and so to not do that would be like, I don't know, almost like unhealthy." When asked about the band's future minus Bennington, Shinoda stated, "It's not my goal to look for a new singer. If it does happen, it has to happen naturally. If we find someone that is a great person and good stylistic fit, I could see trying to do some stuff with somebody. I would never want to feel like we are replacing Chester." [226]. Shinoda, Farrell and Hahn began working on new music together, without any public announcement, by 2019, and were later rejoined by Delson, although Bourdon chose not to participate. The band met Dead Sara vocalist Emily Armstrong in 2019, and began working on music with her shortly after, along with various other musicians, including drummer Colin Brittain. On April 28, 2020, bassist Dave Farrell revealed the band was working on new music [1]. On August 13, the band released "She Couldn't", a track that was originally recorded in 1999, and it was included on a 20th anniversary edition of their debut album Hybrid Theory, released on October 9 [227]. On January 8, 2021, Linkin Park released a remix of "One Step Closer" by American electronic duo 100 gecs [228]. The band revealed it was the first of many new remixes inspired by Reanimation to come. On October 29, when asked about the band playing live shows again, Shinoda stated, "Now is not the time  [for the band's return] [229]. We don't have the focus on it. We don't have the math worked out. And I don't mean that by financially math, I mean that like emotional and creative math."  In April 2022, Shinoda reiterated that the band was not working on a new album, new music, or touring [230]. In February 2023, the band started an interactive game on their website teasing the 20th anniversary of Meteora. On February 6, they revealed a previously unreleased demo, "Lost", that was formally released on February 10, as the lead single from the reissue of the album, released on April 7 [233]. The second single, "Fighting Myself" was released on March 24 [234] [235]. 

## 2023–present: Reformation and From Zero

Unbeknownst to the public, in 2023, the band approached Armstrong and Brittain to reform as Linkin Park to record and release new music and perform the band's back catalogue. A previously unreleased song from the One More Light sessions, "Friendly Fire", was released on February 23, 2024 [1]. This was followed up by the band's first greatest hits album, Papercuts, which was released on April 12 [238] [239]. The collection also includes "Friendly Fire", as well as the first official release of the song "Qwerty", which first appeared on LP Underground 6.0 in 2006. On April 30, 2024, Billboard reported that Linkin Park's booking agency WME had taken offers for both a potential reunion tour and headlining festival dates to take place in 2025, with the lineup featuring Shinoda, Delson, Farrell, and a female vocalist in place of Bennington [240]. At a livestreamed event on September 5, Linkin Park announced the band's comeback, including Armstrong and Brittain's entry into the band. In addition, the band performed and released "The Emptiness Machine", the lead single of the group's eighth album From Zero, which was released on November 15, 2024 [1] [242] [243]. The band's decision to add Armstrong was met with some criticism due to her connections with the Church of Scientology and perceived support of convicted rapist Danny Masterson [1] [242] [243]. The Mars Volta frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala, who had first directed the aforementioned accusations towards Armstrong back in 2023, stated that Linkin Park was "not doing their due diligence before hiring her";  one of Bennington's sons said that Linkin Park "betrayed the trust" of the fanbase with the change [244] [245] [244]. Armstrong responded to the criticism via an Instagram story, stating that she had not been in contact with Masterson since attending his 2020 court appearance and that she condemned his crimes;   however, she did not clarify her status with Scientology [245] [246] [247]. Though, BBC noted that the lyrical content she wrote for Dead Sara suggests Armstrong's rejection of their teachings [244] [246]. Linkin Park embarked on a nine-date arena tour across four continents on September 11 at the Kia Forum in Inglewood. After Alex Feder performed in his place at the comeback event, Delson announced his decision to withdraw from touring to concentrate on the "behind the scenes" aspects of the band [243]. The tour is scheduled to conclude in São Paulo, Brazil, on November 16, 2024 [249]. According to Shinoda, Linkin Park will be "touring heavily" in 2025 [250]. The album's second single, "Heavy Is the Crown", was released on September 24, 2024, and was used as the main theme for Riot Games' 2024 League of Legends World Championship [1] [242]. The album's third single, "Over Each Other", was released on October 24, 2024 [251] [252]. The album's fourth single, "Two Faced", was released on November 13, 2024 [253]. 

# Philanthropy

On January 19, 2010, Linkin Park released a new song titled "Not Alone" as part of a compilation from Music for Relief called Download to Donate for Haiti in support of the Haiti Earthquake crisis. On February 10, 2010, Linkin Park released the official music video for the song on their homepage [256] [257] [258]. The single itself was released on October 21, 2011. [257] [258]. On January 11, 2011, an updated version of Download to Donate for Haiti was launched, called Download to Donate for Haiti V2.0, with more songs to download. For the updated compilation, the band released Keaton Hashimoto's remix of "The Catalyst" from the "Linkin Park featuring YOU" contest [259]. Shinoda designed two T-shirts, in which the proceeds would go to Music for Relief to help the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disasters. Music for Relief released Download to Donate: Tsunami Relief Japan, another compilation of songs, in which the proceeds would go to Save the Children [260] [261]. The band released the song titled as "Issho Ni", meaning "we're in this together", on March 22, 2011, via Download to Donate: Tsunami Relief Japan [262]. In the wake of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, Linkin Park played at Club Nokia during the "Music for Relief: Concert for the Philippines" in Los Angeles, and raised donations for victims. The show was broadcast on AXS TV on February 15 [264] [265]. Other artists during the show included the Offspring, Bad Religion, Heart, and the Filharmonic [264] [265]. 

# Musical style and influences

Linkin Park combines elements of metal, industrial, punk, pop, electronic and hip hop. More specifically, the band has been categorized as alternative rock, nu metal, rap rock, rap metal, alternative metal, electronic rock, pop rock, hard rock, and industrial rock [266]. [note 1] Despite being considered nu metal, the band never considered themselves as such. Both Hybrid Theory and Meteora combine alternative metal,  nu metal,  rap rock,  rap metal,  and alternative rock  sounds with elements of hip hop and electronica,   utilizing programming and synthesizers [292] [293] [294] [295] [296] [297] [298]. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic regarded it as "a Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style,"  whereas Rolling Stone described their song "Breaking the Habit" as "risky, beautiful art" [299]. In Minutes to Midnight, the band experimented with their established sound and drew influences from a wider and more varied range of genres and styles, a process Los Angeles Times compares to a stage in U2's work. Only two songs on the album's tracklist feature rap vocals and the majority of the album can be considered as alternative rock [301]. The vocal interplay between Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda played as a major part within Linkin Park's music, with Bennington being the lead vocalist and Shinoda as the rapping vocalist. On Linkin Park's third album, Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda sings lead vocals on "In Between", "Hands Held High", and on the B-side "No Roads Left". On numerous songs from the band's fourth album, A Thousand Suns, such as the album's singles ("The Catalyst", "Burning in the Skies", "Iridescent"), both Shinoda and Bennington sing. The album has been regarded as a turning point in the band's musical career, having a stronger emphasis on electronica. James Montgomery, of MTV, compared the record to Radiohead's Kid A,  while Jordy Kasko of Review, Rinse, Repeat likened the album to both Kid A and Pink Floyd's landmark album The Dark Side of the Moon [304] [314] [306]. Shinoda stated that he and the other band members were deeply influenced by Chuck D and Public Enemy [310]. He elaborated: "Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff going on in there too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively". One of the record's political elements is its samples of speeches by American political figures [308]. A Thousand Suns was described as trip hop,  electronic rock,   ambient,  alternative rock,  industrial rock,  experimental rock,  rap rock,  and progressive rock [309] [310] [285] [311] [310] [312] [290] [313] [314]. Their fifth album, Living Things, is also an electronic-heavy album, but includes other influences, resulting in a harder sound by comparison. The band returned to a heavier sound compared to their last three albums on The Hunting Party, which was described as an alternative metal,    nu metal,  hard rock,   rap rock,  and rap metal album [316] [317] [318] [319] [320] [321] [318] [322] [323]. Their seventh album, One More Light, was described as pop,   pop rock   and electropop [324] [325] [326] [288] [327]. Linkin Park's influences include  Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Jane's Addiction, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Skinny Puppy, Machines of Loving Grace, Metallica, Refused, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Descendents, Misfits, Beastie Boys, Run-DMC, A Tribe Called Quest, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, N.W.A, Public Enemy, KRS-One, Boogie Down Productions, Led Zeppelin, Rage Against the Machine, Strife, Helmet, and the Beatles. Many of the group's song lyrics deal with alienation, introversion, and personal struggle and suffering. 

# Legacy

Linkin Park has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. The group's first studio album Hybrid Theory is one of the best-selling albums in the US (12 million copies shipped) and worldwide (30 million copies sold) [335] [336].

In Canada, the album sold over 50,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart [349]. Worldwide, the album shipped over 3.3 million copies in its first four weeks of release. The New York Times' Jon Caramanica commented Linkin Park "brought the collision of hard rock and hip-hop to its commercial and aesthetic peak" at the beginning of the 2000s. Several rock and non-rock artists have cited Linkin Park as an influence, including Of Mice & Men,  One OK Rock,  Kutless,  My Heart to Fear,  Ill Niño,  Bishop Nehru,  From Ashes to New,  Bring Me the Horizon,  Spyair,  Hardy,  I Prevail,  Crossfaith,  AJ Tracey,  the Chainsmokers,  the Devil Wears Prada,  Steve Aoki,  Blackbear,  Halsey,  Amber Liu,  Machine Gun Kelly,  Billie Eilish,  Starset,  the Weeknd,  and You Me at Six [351] [352] [353] [354] [355] [356] [357] [358] [359] [360] [361] [362] [363] [364] [365] [366] [367] [368] [369] [370] [371] [372] [373] [374].
