In the final, she started poorly in the first few round to be tied sixth before she progressed up the order to be ranked joint second, one point behind the leader after the seventh series. But a poor score in the next series where she missed three shots out of five meant that she was level on points with Veronica Major of Hungary. In the shoot-off for third place, Bhaker started strongly before two missed shots to finish fourth and miss out on a third medal. In the mixed 10 m air pistol event, she teamed up with Sarabjot Singh to finish third in the qualification and secured entry to the bronze medal match.

Qualification was awarded through a combination of ITTF rankings, continental quotas and world qualification tournaments. NOCs which have qualified for the team events were eligible to field two players each for the singles events. Indian men's and women's team qualified for the games by virtue of their ITTF rankings and as a result, two players automatically qualified for the men's and women's singles events [170]. The Indian squad for the event was announced on 26 May 2024 and consisted of six players across four events [171]. Sharath Kamal made his fifth appearance at the Olympics while Manika Batra competed in her third successive Games.

In the second match, Batra was defeated by lower ranked Annett Kaufmann before Archana Kamath secured a victory against the higher ranked Shan Xiaona. But Kaufmann once again stunned the higher ranked Akula to win the match and knock the Indian team out of the competition. Legend: W = Win; L = Loss. 

# Tennis

As per the International Tennis Federation, the main qualifying criterion was based on the players' positions on the ATP Entry Ranking and WTA ranking lists published on 10 June 2024. Additionally, players had to have been part of the nominated team for three Davis Cup (men) events after the last Olympics. The top 56 ranked players in the singles event qualified directly with spots allocated to subsequent ranked players if the NOCs exhaust the quota of four. Sumit Nagal qualified for the men's singles on the qualification criteria based on his ATP ranking of 77 [181]. For the doubles event, top ten ranked players qualified directly and were allowed to choose their partners ranked under 400. Rohan Bopanna's fourth ranking in the ATP rankings secured an entry in the men's doubles event, where he chose to partner Sriram Balaji [181]. Bopanna competed in his third Olympics and was the oldest athlete of the Indian contingent at 44 while Nagal competed in his second Olympic Games [183]. The tennis events were held from 27 July to 4 August at the Stade Roland Garros. In the men's singles, Nagal faced off against the higher ranked French opponent Corentin Moutet, whom he had beaten in their only previous meeting [186]. Nagal lost the first set before he broke back twice to secure the second set 6–2. But he lost the closely contested third set and the match to  be eliminated from the competition.

The top eight athletes by ranking points obtained from 1 August 2022 to 28 April 2024 in each weight category qualified directly subject to the above condition. Tokyo 2020 silver medalist Saikhom Mirabai Chanu secured one of the top ten slots in the women's 49 kg weight division based on the IWF Olympic qualification rankings. The main event took place on 7 August at the Paris Expo Porte de Versailles. Mirabai Chanu lifted 85 kg on her first snatch attempt [189]. However, she registered an unsuccessful second attempt to lift 88 kg, which was one kg more than her lift at the previous Olympics and matched her personal best. In the third and final attempt, she cleared the same weight and was ranked joint-third along with Surodchana Khambao of Thailand. In the clean & jerk, she had the highest first attempt weight, set at 111 kg. She faltered in the first attempt but cleared the same in the second attempt. Khambao lifted 112 kg, which forced Mirabai Chanu to try 114 kg for a medal place. But she couldn't clear the weight and finished with 111 kg lift, which was way below her personal mark of 119 kg. As a result, she finished fourth overall, and missed out on a bronze medal by a single kg. 

# Wrestling

As per the United World Wrestling, each NOC was allowed to enter a maximum of 18 wrestlers with one per event. Quotas were allocated at the 2023 World Wrestling Championships, continental tournaments (including 2024 Asian Wrestling Olympic Qualification Tournament for Asia) and 2024 World Wrestling Olympic Qualification Tournament.

Vinesh Phogat, Anshu Malik, and Reetika Hooda secured quotas in the women's 50kg,  57 kg,  and 76 kg categories respectively at the 2024 Asian Qualification Tournament held in April 2024 at Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan [192] [193] [194]. Nisha Dahiya and Aman Sehrawat qualified for the women's 68 kg and men's 57 kg event respectively through the 2024 World Qualification Tournament held in Istanbul in May 2024 [195]. India entered the six qualified wrestlers in the freestyle category for the Games [196] [197]. The wrestling events took place between 5 August and 11 August at the Grand Palais Éphémère in Champ de Mars. In the women's 68 kg event, Dahiya defeated fifth seed Tetiana Rizhko of Ukraine in the first round [199]. Though the Ukrainian took an early lead, Dahiya mounted a comeback to take the contest. In the quarterfinals, she took a commanding 8–1 lead against Pak Sol-gum of North Korea. But a dislocated shoulder and a finger injury meant that she struggled with pain heading into the final minute of the bout and lost 8–10 after the North Korean took advantage of the situation to score nine straight points in quick succession. In the first round of the women's 50 kg event, Vinesh Phogat defeated reigning Olympic and world champion Yui Susaki of Japan, who had not conceded a single point to an opponent in the Tokyo Olympics. The match was a cagey affair with Susaki leading 2–0 through two penalty points until the final few seconds when the Indian effected a takedown and scored an upset win [203]. Phogat beat Oksana Livach of Ukraine in the quarterfinals and Yusneylys Guzmán of Cuba in the semifinals by point decisions to qualify for the final [204]. However, Phogat was later disqualified for being 100g above the stipulated weight during the weigh-in on the morning of the finals [205]. As a result, she was relegated to last place in the classification [206] [207]. In the women's 53 kg event, Olympic debutant Panghal lost to Turkey's Zeynep Yetgil in the round of 16 bout, which ended in less than two minutes. Likewise, in the women's 57 kg event, Malik was beaten by Helen Maroulis of the United States in the round of 16 [209]. In the men's 57 kg event, Aman Sehrawat beat Vladimir Egorov of North Macedonia in his first round. He scored ten consecutive points to beat his opponent comfortably by technical superiority. In the quarterfinals, he again scored a similar victory against Zelimkhan Abakarov of Albania within four minutes to make it to the semifinals [210]. In the semifinals, he lost to Japan's Rei Higuchi within four minutes after failing to score a single point [211]. In the bronze medal bout, he faced Darian Cruz of Puerto Rico [212]. Though both the wrestlers scored points initially, Sehrawat led 6–3 at half-time. He dominated the second half to win the bout by a scoreline of 13-5 and took the bronze medal. In the women's 76 kg event, Hooda defeated eighth seed Bernadett Nagy of Hungary in the round of 16 by technical superiority. In the quarterfinals, she faced top seed Aiperi Medet Kyzy of Kyrgyzstan [215]. It was a close match where neither wrestler gained a decisive advantage and the score finished tied at one point apiece. But as the Kyrgyz wrestler scored the last point, she won as per the count-back mechanism and as a result, Hooda failed to advance to the semifinals.
