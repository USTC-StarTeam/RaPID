# Plot

In 2008, in Kenya, the Special Anti-Terrorism Squad (SATS), consisting of M. S. Gandhi and his teammates Sunil Thiagarajan, Kalyan Sundaram and Ajay Govindharaj, intercepted the terrorist Omar to extract uranium from him. Their former chief, Rajiv Menon, absconding after being charged with treason, is also on the same train. They retrieve the uranium from Menon and destroy the train he was on, believing everyone on board, including Menon, to have died. In Delhi, the team lives undercover as India Tourism Development Corporation employees, hiding their real jobs from their families. Gandhi lives with his wife, Anuradha "Anu", who is pregnant, and their five-year-old son, Jeevan.. Gandhi takes his family along to alleviate Anu's suspicions of infidelity when he is assigned a new mission in Bangkok. After completing the mission, Gandhi and his family are attacked, leading to Anu giving birth to a baby girl and Jeevan mysteriously disappearing. The police find a charred body believed to be Jeevan's, leaving Gandhi devastated. Anu stops speaking to Gandhi out of grief.. By 2024, Gandhi had left the squad and would be working as an immigration officer at Chennai International Airport. He and Anu live separately, and their daughter, Jeevitha, lives with Anu. Upon Kalyan's suggestion, Gandhi's former boss, Nazeer, asks him to go to Moscow to train new officers at the reopened Indian Embassy. Though reluctant, Gandhi agrees, but during his time there, a gang attacks the embassy. Gandhi fights them off and is shocked to see one of the attackers, a young doppelgänger. He realizes it is Jeevan and confirms this when he helps him fend off the attackers. They return to Chennai, and the family reunites, with Anu starting to speak to Gandhi again. Nazeer calls Gandhi for an urgent meeting at the Chennai Metro station, stating that the information is confidential and cannot mention any details over the phone. A masked man attacks Nazeer. Gandhi arrives just in time to fight off the attacker, but the masked man kills Nazeer, who turns out to be Jeevan.. Gandhi returns to the SATS squad to find who is trying to cause a threat to their agency. Nazeer's phone has all the information about Jeevan and his gang from Moscow. Jeevan's accomplice Sha took the phone from Nazeer in the Metro station when Nazeer dropped it. But Sha reveals to Jeevan that the phone went missing. As it turns out, Jeevan has been working for Menon all this time and has come to Gandhi's family for a reason.. Menon survived the train explosion in 2008 but lost his wife and children in the incident. Seeking revenge, he tracked Gandhi to Bangkok, kidnapped Jeevan, and placed him in a juvenile facility, instilling fear in him. He then "rescued" Jeevan by killing the members of the facility, earning his trust and renaming him Sanjay after his deceased son. Jeevan, manipulated by Menon, came to believe Gandhi was responsible for the deaths of his family. Fueled by this hatred, Jeevan dedicated his life to Menon and his revenge on Gandhi.. Diamond Babu, a thief, steals Nazeer's phone that contains key evidence; Gandhi tries to repurchase it, but Jeevan intervenes, leading to a deadly confrontation in which Jeevan murders Ajay. Abdul and Menon's arrest prompts Jeevan to kidnap Srinidhi, blackmailing Sunil to secure their release. Kalyan, revealed to be Menon's accomplice, convinces Gandhi to free them. Jeevan slashes Srinidhi's throat, and Kalyan suffocates her to prevent her from becoming a key witness. While tracking down Sha, Gandhi coincidentally finds Jeevan and arrests him. During interrogation, he seizes Sunil's gun, seemingly kills him and forces Gandhi to escort him out, allowing Jeevan to escape. However, Sunil is revealed to be alive and kills Kalyan. In the meantime, Menon kidnaps Anu and reveals a bombing plan, unaware it is Gandhi's ploy. Gandhi captures Menon and brings him to the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium to negotiate with Jeevan, preventing the bombing. Jeevan plans to detonate multiple bombs at the stadium and frame Gandhi for treason. Gandhi, with the help of his brother-in-law Seenu and Jeevitha, manages to get hold of the detonator. Jeevan threatens Jeevitha's life, but Gandhi saves her and kills him.. In the mid-credits scene, "Jeevan" is a clone. Jeevan, still known as Sanjay, is a scientist who has since created more clones to target Gandhi..

# Reception

## Critical response

The Greatest of All Time received mixed reviews from critics who praised Vijay's performance and action sequences while the lack of character development and writing received criticism. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 40% of 10 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.3/10 [145] [146]. Kaushik Ramachandran of DT Next gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote " [...] Despite these minor issues, The Greatest Of All Time is undoubtedly worth watching and delivers the much-needed hit that Tamil cinema has been anticipating."  Sridevi S of The Times of India gave 3/5 stars and wrote "Endless fan moments, all mass and no solid substance makes GOAT an average watch for the film lovers, and a celebrated watch for his hard-core fans [148]. In his 32-year-odd career and 68 films, GOAT is good, but definitely not Greatest Of All Times!"  Goutham S of Pinkvilla gave 3/5 stars and wrote "Thalapathy Vijay’s The GOAT is undoubtedly a full-fledged action flick that is catered to his fans [149]. If you love watching him in a swash-buckling avatar or if you want to catch him in a totally new element, then this film is surely meant for you."  Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave 3.5/4 stars and wrote "Here he  [Vijay] delivers the best of his recent movies’ dance numbers as well as the most polished fight and action scenes, as well as more crowd-pleasing tangents and dramatic build-up than even in “Master,” his best recent movie [150]. “The Greatest of All Time” still makes a lusty grab for that distinction simply by going for broke harder than most." [151]. Janani K of India Today gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote "'GOAT' is inconsistent and comes together in the pre-climax and climax sequence. Wait for the brilliant cameos and references that will make up for the shortcomings."  Avinash Ramachandran of The Indian Express gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote "There is no doubt that GOAT is indeed a celebration of all things Vijay [152]. His dancing, action sequences, comic timing, vulnerability, romantic charm, and effortless superstardom are all stuff of dreams. A dream that is slowly moving away from the audience."  Anusha Sundar of OTTPlay gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote "There is no denial that The GOAT is a film that warrants a theatre watch given you go in as a fan, expecting less to chew and more to celebrate [153]. Vijay pulls off his yet another acting stint following up with Leo. However, there is so much only Vijay and all the fan tributes can do, when the film lacks enough material to soak in". Kirubhakar Purushothaman of News18 gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote "The actual mission here is of director Venkat Prabhu, and his objective is to keep bringing out those cheers and hoots every few minutes with some callbacks, easter eggs, and cameos. The hurdle in the mission is that he has to achieve it without having a lot going on in the film. In a way, the operation is a success, but GOAT as a film… not so much."  Divya Nair of Rediff.com gave 2/5 stars and wrote "recommends that non-Vijay fans save their money and wait for GOAT to drop on Netflix [155]. At least you can fast forward and get to the climax faster."  Arun Antony of Deccan Chronicle gave 2/5 stars and wrote "The Greatest of All Time’aka Vijay’s The GOAT is nothing but passable and boring [156]. Venkat Prabhu who has consistently entertained the audience with funny storylines and quirky twists in his previous films, hits the wrong balls in this pointlessly cricket-based movie." [157]. Manoj Kumar R of Desimartini gave 2/5 stars and wrote "Instead of focusing on crafting a tight and compelling story, Venkat Prabhu chooses to piggyback on Vijay’s star power, assuming that the actor’s charming screen presence can mask the film’s flaws. When even Vijay’s superstardom isn’t enough to salvage the movie, Venkat turns to nostalgia and references to other stars like Dhoni, Rajinikanth, and Ajith."  Suhas Sistu of The Hans India rated 2/5 stars and wrote "While the film delivers on star power, it falls short in delivering a gripping, fresh narrative."  A critic of Sakshi Post rated 2/5 stars and wrote "Because of its weak action scenes and mediocre villain, "GOAT" may appear to audiences from other states as an ordinary to above-average entertainer."  Latha Srinivasan of Hindustan Times wrote "GOAT is a Venkat Prabhu treat for Thalapathy Vijay fans and the audience [158] [159] [160]. This Vijay film is an action-packed, fun, wholesome entertainer!"  Gopinath Rajendran of The Hindu wrote "GOAT might let you down if you’re expecting a globe-trotting espionage thriller, or just a genre-specific entertainer along the lines of Venkat Prabhu’s Maanaadu [161]. But if you want to catch the celebration of one of our most popular stars doing everything we love in his penultimate outing, then The Greatest of All Time is worth the entry fee." [162]. Upon release, many viewers noted the film's similarities to Rajadurai, a 1993 Tamil film. Prabhu acknowledged the similarities, but alleged it was all coincidental as he had not seen the older film. 

## Box office

The Greatest of All Time grossed ₹100.5 crore (US$12 million) worldwide on its opening day, which was the second highest first day gross for a Tamil film,  with over ₹53 crore (US$6.1 million) from India [164].

# Controversies

After the announcement of the film's title, Telugu film director Naresh Kuppili reportedly raised objections against the title, stating that he was already working on a project with the same title, and demanded a stall on the Tamil film's release until the issues were cleared. Following the release of "Whistle Podu", a social activist filed a police complaint at Mylapore Police Station in Chennai to DGP Office, stating that the lyrical video did not feature any disclaimer on drinking or smoking and promotes drug addiction and rowdyism to the youth, demanding an action towards Vijay and ban to the song. After the reservations of the film began in Tamil Nadu, Rohini Silver Screens, a multiplex in Koyambedu received complaints on social media platforms for charging high prices of ₹390 per ticket, with the food options being mandatory for the audiences, despite government restrictions. This was followed by a social activist filing a formal complaint at the Chennai Police Commissionerate office demanding action against theatres which were charging above the government-stipulated for the film and crackdown on theatres running unauthorised shows outside of permitted hours. 

# Future

In the film's mid-credits scene, it was announced that a sequel titled The Greatest of All Time vs Original Gangster (shortened as GOAT vs OG) was in progress. However, the project's viability was questioned by media outlets and Vijay's fans due to him announcing his decision to quit acting to focus on his political career [182].
