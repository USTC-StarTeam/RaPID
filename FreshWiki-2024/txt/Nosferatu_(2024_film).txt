Nosferatu_(2024_film)

Nosferatu is a 2024 American gothic horror film written and directed by Robert Eggers. It is a remake of the film Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922), itself an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula (1897). It stars Bill Skarsgård as Count Orlok, with Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp starring as Thomas and Ellen Hutter. The supporting cast includes Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Emma Corrin, Ralph Ineson, Simon McBurney, and Willem Dafoe.
Development began in 2015, when Eggers planned to make it his second film; he described it as a passion project, but eventually opted to delay its production. Skarsgård and Depp were cast in lead roles in September 2022. Filming took place primarily at Barrandov Studios in Prague between February and May 2023.
Nosferatu had its world premiere in Berlin on December 2, 2024. It was theatrically released in the United States by Focus Features and internationally by Universal Pictures on December 25, 2024. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $156.8 million worldwide on a $50 million budget, becoming Eggers' highest-grossing film.

# Plot

In the early 1830s, a young girl named Ellen pleads for a supernatural being to arrive and ease her loneliness. Her cries awaken a mysterious creature who makes her pledge herself to him eternally.. In 1838, Ellen is married to Thomas Hutter, with whom she lives in the German town of Wisburg. To ensure financial security, Thomas accepts a commission from his employer, Herr Knock, to sell the decrepit home Grünewald Manor to the reclusive Count Orlok. Ellen begs him to stay since she is haunted by dreams of marrying Death himself and is disturbed by the pleasure the dreams give her. Thomas leaves her in the care of his wealthy friend Friedrich Harding, alongside Friedrich's pregnant wife Anna and their two young daughters.. Arriving in the Carpathian Alps of Transylvania, Thomas is shunned by the local peasantry for associating with Orlok. That night, he witnesses a group of Roma exhuming and impaling an alleged vampire's corpse with a stake, causing it to vomit blood. The following morning, Thomas finds the entire village and his own horse gone. He continues his trip on foot and is approached by an unmanned carriage, which takes him to Orlok's castle.. Thomas meets with the strange, menacing Orlok and is forced to complete the property sale immediately. When Thomas accidentally cuts himself during dinner, he blacks out and awakens to find bite marks on his chest. Orlok steals Thomas' locket containing a lock of Ellen's hair and coerces him into signing a document, which Orlok implies is the contract for the sale of Grünewald Manor, though it is written in occult script that Thomas cannot read. Becoming increasingly sick, Thomas later finds Orlok sleeping in a coffin and attempts to stake him, but Orlok awakens and feeds on him again. Thomas escapes Orlok's wolves and is nursed back to health by Orthodox nuns at a nearby church. Meanwhile, Orlok sets sail for Wisburg on a ship with plague-carrying rats, killing the crew members along the way.. Ellen suffers from sleepwalking and seizures that her doctor, Wilhelm Sievers, struggles to treat. Wilhelm locates and consults with his former mentor, Albin Eberhart Von Franz, a Swiss scientist ostracized for his occult beliefs and research into alchemy. Albin believes that Ellen is under the spell of a demonic, plague-bearing vampire called the Nosferatu. Knock is institutionalized after killing sheep and eating them raw. Wilhelm and Albin search Knock's office, believing he is a servant of the Nosferatu, who is revealed as Count Orlok.. Thomas returns to Wisburg as Orlok's plague begins to ravage its populace. Knock kills a guard, escapes custody, and escorts Orlok to Grünewald Manor. Orlok appears to Ellen and confesses that, while he is incapable of love, her eternal pledge has intertwined their destinies and made his desire to possess her insatiable. The document he tricked Thomas into signing is revealed to void the Hutters' marriage. Orlok, knowing that his bond with Ellen cannot be sustained by force, tells her that she must willingly submit to him within three nights or he will kill Thomas and let the plague consume Wisburg. Ellen later has sex with Thomas after confessing her past with Orlok and experiencing a seizure, which Orlok sees telepathically, prompting him to retaliate by killing Anna and her children. Driven mad with grief, Friedrich dies from the plague while lying with Anna's corpse.. Albin's occult research suggests that the Nosferatu can be destroyed by a fair maiden's willing sacrifice. Knowing that she is the only person who can stop the plague, Ellen conspires with Albin to keep Thomas distracted so he cannot stop her from sacrificing herself. Thomas, Albin, and Wilhelm go to Grünewald Manor, where they accidentally kill Herr Knock after finding him sleeping in Orlok's coffin. Realizing Albin's deception, Thomas rushes back to his home to save Ellen as Albin destroys the coffin. Ellen summons Orlok to her bedroom and re-pledges herself to him, distracting him by allowing him to feed on her blood until sunrise, when the sunlight kills him. Thomas returns and holds Ellen's hand as she dies with Orlok's body on top of her. Albin confirms that her sacrifice has freed them from the plague of the Nosferatu.. 

# Production

## Development

In July 2015, the remake of Nosferatu (1922) was announced with Robert Eggers writing and directing. Jay Van Hoy and Lars Knudsen were slated to produce the film for Studio 8. In November 2016, Eggers expressed surprise that the Nosferatu remake was his second planned film, saying, "It feels ugly and blasphemous and egomaniacal and disgusting for a filmmaker in my place to do Nosferatu next [5]. I was really planning on waiting a while, but that's how fate shook out."  During an interview with Den of Geek around the release of The Lighthouse (2019), Eggers revealed that although he had dedicated a lot of time to bringing the story into the 21st century, he did not know when or if it would happen [6]. He said that he "spent so many years and so much time  [...] it would be a real shame if it never happened". 

## Script

The film is a remake of Nosferatu, following the original made by F. W. Murnau in 1922 from a script by Henrik Galeen and the 1979 remake by Werner Herzog. Nosferatu actually came about because Murnau and his producers decided to make a film about Dracula but without using Bram Stoker's 1897 novel in order to avoid paying royalties. The producers therefore changed some small details to avoid problems with the copyright holders. The film was loosely based on the book, but the names of the characters were changed. The version is set in 19th-century Germany and is based on the same premise as Stoker's Dracula. After the original film's release, a lawsuit was filed against the producers of Nosferatu which resulted in an order to destroy all copies of the film, but some copies survived and were restored after the death of Stoker's widow Florence Balcombe and the subsequent expiration of the copyright. Eggers's early fascination with Nosferatu ignited a passion for filmmaking that would shape his career. He became inspired by both Henrik Galeen's screenplay and Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula, and with high school classmate Ashley Kelly-Tata adapted the story for the stage, performing it at their school. Their production caught the eye of Edouard Langlois, who invited them to transfer it to New York's Edwin Booth Theatre. Eggers stated that " [v]ampirism and Dracula is the thing that I've been thinking about and looking at for a long time" [9]. "I had read Montague Summers as a teenager, and many other authors of vampire lore, but I think, until I set out to make Nosferatu, I was still too contaminated by the cinematic tropes. And so, you're infusing things you're reading with cinematic tropes that aren't there. In doing the research to write this script, I needed to be disciplined to forget what I knew. And then, you start looking at the really early vampire accounts, and you're like, 'They're not even drinking blood, they're just strangling people, or suffocating people, or fucking them to death.' And that was really interesting." [10]. The character of Orlok is partially inspired by Vlad Dracula, the 15th-century Voivode of Wallachia, whom the original Dracula was named after. Eschewing the monstrous appearance of Murnau's Orlok or the Anglo-literary vampire appearance, Eggers preferred the appearance of a folk vampire, claiming that "there's never been a version of Dracula or Nosferatu dressed like a Transylvanian nobleman with authentic Hungarian attire from the 16th century." Costume designer Linda Muir sought inspiration from the Transylvanian military from around 1560 to the mid-1600s, incorporating pieces of clothing such as dolman, mente or kolpak into Orlok's costume [11]. Inspired by Orlok being an ancient Romanian count, Eggers made the decision to have him speak a reconstructed form of the Dacian language in the film,  while Romanian and Romani are spoken by other Transylvanian residents [12] [13]. The film also makes a nod to director Victor Sjöström's silent classic, The Phantom Carriage (1921) [12]. Eggers also explored the work of French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot and his findings on so-called hysteria  and took inspiration from Andrzej Żuławski's films Possession (1981), The Devil (1972), and The Third Part of the Night (1971) [11] [10]. 

## Casting

In August 2017, actress Anya Taylor-Joy was cast, reteaming with Eggers after The Witch (2015);  she was still attached to project in 2020, though her specific role had not been announced [15]. Harry Styles had been cast to star opposite Taylor-Joy,  but dropped out of the project in 2021 citing scheduling concerns [16] [17]. Eggers initially considered several talents to play the role of Count Orlok, including Daniel Day-Lewis and Mads Mikkelsen. Finally, on September 30, 2022, it was announced that Swedish actor Bill Skarsgård would star in the role of Count Orlok, whom Eggers had also had in mind for the film adaptation years earlier [20]. However, before he was offered the role of the film's titular vampire, Skarsgård had originally auditioned for and been offered the role of Thomas Hutter [21]. The addition of actress Lily-Rose Depp, replacing Anya Taylor-Joy, was also announced on September 30, 2022 [22] [23]. Nicholas Hoult confirmed on October 10, 2022, that he joined the cast after several negotiations, to play Thomas Hutter [21]. [failed verification] [24]. Willem Dafoe joined the cast in January 2023, re-teaming with Eggers after The Lighthouse and The Northman (2022);  Dafoe had not only previously portrayed Max Schreck/Count Orlok in Shadow of the Vampire (2000), but had been slated to play the role again for Eggers [25]. Emma Corrin would join the cast the following month [20] [26]. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Simon McBurney, and Ralph Ineson were announced as joining cast at the start of production in late February 2023 [27]. Romanian TikTok personality Bunica Gherghina was cast as the elderly lady at the Transylvanian inn [28] [29]. Additionally, the film features around 5,000 trained rats [30]. 

## Filming

Principal photography began in the Czech Republic on February 20, 2023,  with filming taking place at Barrandov Studios in Prague by March [32]. Later that month, the crew was shooting on location at the 14th-century Rožmitál pod Třemšínem Castle in Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, Pernštejn Castle  and Prague's Invalidovna complex, a Baroque building registered as a national landmark [33] [34]. Some exterior shots were captured in Corvin Castle  in Romania [35] [36]. Filming wrapped on May 19, 2023 [37]. The film was shot on 35mm film in color by cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, adopting a desaturated look using special filters. To prepare for playing Count Orlok, Skarsgård lost a significant amount of weight and, refusing to have his voice digitally modulated, worked with the Icelandic opera singer Ásgerður Júníusdóttir to lower his vocal range and character, incorporating Mongolian throat singing into his lines,  and spent up to six hours a day having prosthetic makeup applied [42]. Skarsgård likened his experience to "conjuring pure evil."  Hoult said he felt "real fear" when wolves on set had to be restrained before filming chase scenes with him [22]. The film makes use of several custom-made props, some of which were kept by the actors after filming [43]. Eggers gifted Depp the prop of Ellen's locket,  and Hoult kept and framed Orlok's prosthetic penis worn by Skarsgård in the film [44]. The scene of Hutter's arrival in the Transylvanian village was captured in one take. The sequence is made up of nonprofessional Romani actors, musicians and dancers, and features an appearance by Czech musician and actor Jordan Haj. Roughly 30 takes were filmed of what Eggers said was all "very carefully choreographed and rehearsed ahead of time in a warehouse in Prague". The village set was built outside of Prague, and was based on the crew's studies of vernacular architecture museums in Romania and Transylvania. 

# Music

The score is provided by British-Irish film composer and music producer Robin Carolan. Carolan made his film scoring debut in 2022, working with Eggers on the soundtrack for The Northman; on Nosferatu, he intentionally moved away from the typical horror score, focusing on capturing the story's melancholic and tragic elements. He also credited his obsessive listening to Sky Ferreira's 2019 single "Downhill Lullaby" for putting him "in a certain mood" for some of Ellen's scenes [47]. With "Goodbye" and "Increase thy Thunders", the first two pieces of music from the film were released by Back Lot Music in late September 2024. The full soundtrack album with a total of 43 pieces of music is scheduled to be released on vinyl and two CDs by Sacred Bones Records and Waxwork Records. At the helm as conductor is British-born Daniel Pioro [47]. Carolan and Eggers struggled to perfect their sound, a process marked by their meticulous attention to detail, which Carolan describes as "almost telepathic" [47]. 

# Release

Nosferatu had its world premiere on December 2, 2024, at the Zoo Palast cinema in Berlin, Germany. The film was released in the United States by Focus Features and internationally by Universal Pictures on December 25, 2024 [48]. The film was shown in IMAX,  as well as in Dolby Cinema,  and screened in 35mm in some theatres, including Grauman's Chinese Theatre in California [49] [50] [51] [52]. The film was released on digital platforms on January 21, 2025 [53]. An extended version will be released later on Blu-ray [54]. 

# Reception

## Box office

As of January 21, 2025 [update], Nosferatu has grossed $90.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $66.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $156.8 million. In the United States and Canada, Nosferatu  was released alongside A Complete Unknown, Babygirl and The Fire Inside and was originally projected to gross around $25 million from 2,992 theaters in its five-day opening weekend. After making $11.55 million on its first day and $7.6 million on its second, estimates were raised to $42 million [4]. It went on to debut to $21.7 million in its opening weekend (and a total of $40.8 million over the five days), finishing in third behind Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Mufasa: The Lion King. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the movie an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale. In its second weekend, the film made $13.1 million [56]. 

## Critical response

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 84% of 328 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8/10. The website's consensus reads: "Marvelously orchestrated by director Robert Eggers, Nosferatu is a behemoth of a horror film that is equal parts repulsive and seductive."  Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews [58]. The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney praised the direction, screenplay and performances, calling the film "exciting, repulsive and beautiful", and added that "It's thrilling to experience a movie so assured in the way it builds and sustains fear, so hypnotically scary as it grabs you by the throat and never lets go."  IndieWire's David Ehrlich similarly praised the direction and singled out Depp's performance before stating that "like all of Eggers' films, of which Nosferatu is the richest and most fully realized, it draws a spellbinding power from the friction it finds between historical social mores and the eternal human thirsts they exist to keep in check." [60] [61]. 

## Filmmakers' responses

Filmmaker David Lowery named it one of his favorite films of 2024, saying, "Robert has made a vampire film steeped in woe, but I can only imagine how utterly overjoyed he was to be making it. Who knows if he was actually laughing behind the camera, but it's pretty hard not to hear him all the same ­— and this joy, imagined or not, is vicarious."  Filmmaker Sean Baker similarly praised the film, writing, "It's going to be very hard to beat Nosferatu for my fav [orite] film of the year [62]. Must see on the big screen. Eggers's direction is masterful and Lily-Rose Depp and Nicholas Hoult deserve best actor noms. Glorious cinematography, score, production design and editing. My God this is an incredible film."  Other filmmakers, including David Fincher, Maggie Betts, Savanah Leaf, JT Mollner, Daniel Scheinert, Juel Taylor and Malcolm Washington also praised the film [63].
