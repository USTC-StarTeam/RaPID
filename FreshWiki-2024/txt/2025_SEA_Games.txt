2025_SEA_Games

The 2025 SEA Games (Thai: กีฬาซีเกมส์ 2025, RTGS: Kila Sikem 2025, pronounced [kīː.lāː sīː.kēːm sɔ̌ːŋ.pʰān.jîː.sìp̚.hâː]), officially called the 33rd SEA Games (Thai: กีฬาซีเกมส์ ครั้งที่ 33 , RTGS: Kila Sikem Khrangthi 33, pronounced [kīː.lāː sīː.kēːm kʰráŋ.tîː sǎːm.sìp̚ sǎːm]) and commonly known as Thailand 2025, is an upcoming international multi-sport event sanctioned by the Southeast Asian Games Federation (SEAGF). The event is scheduled to take place from 9 to 20 December 2025 across the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, as well as the provinces of Chonburi and Songkhla, Thailand.
The joint bid from the three provinces was awarded the Games on 13 January 2023, after Thailand was confirmed as the host country by the Southeast Asian Games Federation (SEAGF). This marks the first time that host cities were selected through a new bidding and election process for the SEA Games.
The 2025 SEA Games will be the seventh time Thailand has hosted the event, with Bangkok having previously hosted in 1959, 1967, 1975, and 1985. It will also be the first time Chonburi and Songkhla have served as the main host cities.

# Host selection

As per the traditions of the SEA Games, hosting duties are rotated among the member countries of the SEA Games Federation (SEAGF). Each member country is assigned a specific year to host the event, but they have the option to withdraw or opt out of hosting in that particular edition. 

## 2019 disruption

On 21 July 2017, the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) announced its decision to withdraw support for the country's hosting of the 2019 SEA Games. The government chose to reallocate funds originally intended for the event to support the rehabilitation of Marawi, which had been devastated by the Marawi crisis. Additionally, it was later reported that the Philippine Olympic Committee's (POC) insistence on handling all aspects of the hosting—including finances, security, and the organization of the Games, similar to how it managed the 2005 SEA Games—contributed to the PSC's decision to withdraw its support . On 10 August 2017, Charouck Arirachakaran, the Vice President and Secretary General of the National Olympic Committee of Thailand (NOCT), stated that Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha had agreed to a replacement plan for the 2019 SEA Games following the Philippines' withdrawal. The potential host provinces for the event were Chiang Mai, Chonburi, and Songkhla. Six days later, the Philippines, through Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) President Peping Cojuangco, confirmed that it would host the 2019 SEA Games. This decision came after Cojuangco wrote to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, appealing for reconsideration of the country's earlier withdrawal. 

## 2025 confirmation

In December 2021, Thailand was nominated as the host country for the 2025 SEA Games during the SEAGF Council and Executive Board Meetings held in Hanoi, Vietnam. Five months later, the SEAGF Council and executive board officially confirmed Thailand as the host for the 2025 Games, with Bangkok initially nominated as the host city [8] [9] [10]. Additionally, Malaysia and Singapore were confirmed as the host countries for the 2027 and 2029 editions of the SEA Games, respectively. After the confirmation, this marked the seventh time that Thailand had hosted the SEA Games. The capital city, Bangkok, hosted the inaugural SEAP Games in 1959, and subsequently in 1967, 1975, and 1985, after the event had become known as the SEA Games. However, the 1995 and 2007 editions were held in the Thai provinces of Chiang Mai and Nakhon Ratchasima, respectively.. 

## Bidding and election

On October 11, 2022, Chaipak Siriwat, the Vice President of the National Olympic Committee of Thailand (NOCT), revealed the framework for the bidding process for the 2025 SEA Games. He emphasized that the host cities or provinces should aim to organize the Games at a budget-friendly cost and that there would be no requirement to build new venues. Unlike the 2019 and 2021 editions, where competition venues were spread across 23 and 12 cities respectively, the number of host cities for the 2025 Games would be limited to 3 or 4. In October 2022, Prachum Boontiem, the Vice Governor of the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT), nominated eight bidding parties from twelve cities or provinces interested in hosting the 2025 SEA Games. The city Bangkok as well as the provinces of Chiang Mai, Nakhon Ratchasima, and Songkhla submitted sole bids, while Bangkok, Chonburi, Songkhla, Krabi, Phuket, Trat, Amnat Charoen, Sisaket, Ubon Ratchathani, and Yasothon were proposed as potential bidding provinces. Although the official bidding process began in October 2022, some regions had already revealed their bidding campaigns earlier: Ubon Ratchathani in April 2016, Chonburi in January 2019, and Krabi, Phuket, and Trang in February 2021. On January 13, 2023, the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT) selected three provinces—Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Chonburi province, and Songkhla province—to host the 33rd SEA Games, while Nakhon Ratchasima province was chosen to host the 13th ASEAN Para Games. This decision was approved by the Cabinet of Thailand in February 2023. These four cities were the first in SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games history to be chosen through a bidding process. [21] [22] [23]. 

## Host city contract

During the first SEAGF council meeting for the 2025 SEA Games in June 2024, the host city contract was signed by Chadchart Sittipunt, the Governor of Bangkok, Thawatchai Srithong, the Governor of Chonburi province, and Somnuek Promkhieo, the Governor of Songkhla province. The ceremony followed the model of the Olympic and Asian Games host city agreements, marking the first time a SEA Games host city contract has been signed [24]. 

# Handover ceremony

As per tradition, the handover ceremony of the SEAGF flag and the artistic performance for the 2025 SEA Games took place during the closing ceremony of the 2023 SEA Games in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 17 May 2023 at the Morodok Techo National Stadium.. First, the SEAGF flag was passed from Vath Chamroeun, the Secretary General of the Cambodia SEA Games Organizing Committee (CAMSOC), Thong Khon, the President of the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia (NOCC), and Tea Banh, the Chairman of CAMSOC, to Prawit Wongsuwan, the President of the National Olympic Committee of Thailand (NOCT), and Gongsak Yodmani, the Governor of the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT). Other delegates at the handover ceremony included Chaiyapak Siriwat, the Vice President of the NOCT; Cherdkiat Atthakor, the Thai Ambassador to Cambodia; Chadchart Sittipunt, the Governor of Bangkok; Niti Wiwatwanich, the Deputy Governor of Chonburi province; Jesada Jitrat, the Governor of Songkhla province; Natt Intracharoen, the Vice Secretary General of the NOCT; and Prachum Boonthiam, the Deputy Governor of SAT. This was followed by the raising of the Thai flag and the playing of its national anthem. The artistic performance for this segment, titled Sawasdee SEA Games, meaning Hello SEA Games in Thai, was performed by Kid Buaksib, a contemporary Thai dancer and artist. They were a finalist in seasons 1 and 2 of Thailand's Got Talent. [29] [30] [31]. 

# Kick-off ceremony

The kick-off ceremony for the 2025 SEA Games and the 2025 ASEAN Para Games was held at the Hua Mak Sports Complex in Bangkok on December 7, 2024. The event was attended by Sorawong Thienthong, Chairman of the Organizing Committee and Minister of Tourism and Sports (MOTS), along with Gongsak Yodmani, Governor of the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT), representatives from the National Olympic Committee of Thailand (NOCT), the Paralympic Committee of Thailand (PCT), and various national sports associations [32] [33]. The event also featured renowned athletes, including Vareeraya Sukasem, an Olympic skateboarder, and Saysunee Jana, a five-time Paralympic gold medalist in wheelchair fencing. Additionally, several celebrities joined the occasion, such as Matthew Deane, Khemanit Jamikorn, James Fagerlund, and Nakorn Silachai. Sorawong announced that the 2025 SEA Games and the 2025 ASEAN Para Games will be held under the themes of Green SEA Games and Sustainable Paralympics. The games aim to achieve net-zero emissions by promoting eco-friendly transportation, utilizing sustainable products, and selecting venues that prioritize environmental protection. This environmentally friendly vision will also be implemented in the 2025 FIVB Women's Volleyball World Championship, scheduled for August earlier in the year [36] [37].

## Coordination Committee of the SEAGF

During the second SEAGF council meeting for the 2025 SEA Games in October 2024, the Coordination Committee of the SEAGF has been appointed to monitor the progress of organizing the 2025 SEA Games. The committee is composed of Chaipak Siriwat, the Vice President of the National Olympic Committee of Thailand (NOCT), along with the Presidents of the other four National Olympic Committees. 

## Steering and Organizing Committees for the Games

Similar to the 2007 SEA Games and the 2008 ASEAN Para Games in Nakhon Ratchasima, the committees for the competition are divided into two main bodies. The Steering Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister of Thailand, is responsible for setting policies, providing recommendations, and allocating budgets to the Organizing Committee. Meanwhile, the Organizing Committee, chaired by the Minister of Tourism and Sports, is tasked with managing the operations of the competition, coordinating with various subcommittees, and overseeing the budget allocated by the Steering Committee. In December 2024, the Steering Committee recognized the organizational structure of the Organizing Committee for the Games. Unlike the previous games, the chairpersons of the subcommittees are all from the Ministry of Tourism and Sports (MOTS) and the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT), with no representatives from the National Olympic Committee of Thailand (NOCT) [43]. 

## Budget

The initial estimated budget for the 2025 SEA Games and the 2025 ASEAN Para Games is ฿2.055 billion. The funding for the events will come from several sources: ฿1.683 billion is being requested from the government budget [45]. Additional revenue includes ฿20 million from sponsorships and ฿180 million from goods and services, such as sports equipment and beverages. Ticket sales are expected to generate ฿20 million. Registration fees for the SEA Games will contribute ฿134.40 million, while registration fees for the ASEAN Para Games will bring in ฿16.80 million. The budget for these events is lower than the cost of the 1998 Asian Games, which was ฿2.372 billion, but higher than the 2007 Summer Universiade, which amounted to ฿1.843 billion. Meanwhile, the costs for the 2007 SEA Games and the 2008 ASEAN Para Games were ฿1.463 billion.. 

# The Games

## Opening ceremony

In May 2023, Gongsak Yodmani, the governor of the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT), announced plans for the opening ceremony of the 2025 SEA Games to be uniquely split across three venues: Rajamangala Stadium in Bangkok, a stadium in Chonburi, and Tinsulanon Stadium in Songkhla. This marks the first time in SEA Games history that the opening ceremony will be held in more than two locations. Inspired from the opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in Paris, France, Sorawong Thienthong, Minister of Tourism and Sports (MOTS) revealed plans to hold part of the ceremony outside traditional stadium settings, utilizing venues designed to accommodate large public gatherings. Gongsak further disclosed that Sanam Luang, set against the backdrop of the Grand Palace, will serve as the main venue for the opening ceremony, with Chonburi and Songkhla still playing significant roles in the event [49]. This will be the second time in SEA Games history that the opening ceremony will be held in outside of a traditional stadium following the 2005 SEA Games at the Quirino Grandstand in the Rizal Park. . Sanam Luang has been used for various royal ceremonies, national events, and public gatherings. In the past, the public square also usually served as a venue for kite flying and hosting the national club sepak takraw championships [51]. 

## Sports

### Charter and Rules amendment

Over the years, the SEA Games programme have faced criticized for being a "gold-medal mine" for host countries. Hosts have had the freedom to exclude Olympic and Asian Games sports that are disadvantageous to them while including non-Olympic sports or events that increase their medal chances. In some extreme cases, obscure sports have been selected to give the host country an advantage. This practice highlights the vulnerability of the Southeast Asian Games Federation (SEAGF) and its Charter and Rules, which grant excessive power to the host nations [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60]. To avoid the bizarre situations seen in recent editions of the SEA Games, Thailand proposed a series of amendments to the SEAGF Charter and Rules in Section 34 during the 2013 edition. Although the Charter and Rules have been amended multiple times since then, host countries were still allowed to allocate their optional sports programs without oversight from the SEAGF [63]. However, following the controversy surrounding the sports program in recent editions, the host countries for the three editions between 2025 and 2029—Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore—agreed to propose further amendments to the Charter and Rules [64]. The new amendments were unanimously approved by SEAGF members at the SEAGF Council meeting during the 2023 SEA Games [65] [66]. This upcoming edition will be the first to implement the new rules. [67] [68]. Section 34 of the amended SEAGF Charter and Rules stipulates that starting with the 2025 edition, the SEA Games program will include a minimum of 41 sports. This will consist of 12 compulsory sports under Category 1, which are included in both the Olympic and Asian Games, a minimum of 25 Olympic and Asian Games sports under Category 2, and a maximum of 4 additional sports under Category 3. The medal events in Categories 1 and 2 must align with the Olympic and Asian Games programs, while events in Category 3 sports cannot exceed eight and must be selected from a pre-established list, which is determined a few years in advance. 

### Sports selection

Following the selection of the host cities, the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT) initially announced that the 2025 SEA Games would feature forty-three sports, in accordance with the Games' charter. All of these sports are included in the Thailand National Games, and the host cities and provinces are equipped to provide the necessary venues and facilities to accommodate these events. Artistic swimming and equestrian will make their return, having last been included in 2017 [22] [23]. Marathon swimming, Muay Thai (muaythai), netball, and winter sports—including figure skating, ice hockey, and short track speed skating—will also return, having last been featured in 2019 [70] [71]. Archery, rowing, and shooting will return as well, having last been included in 2021 [70] [72] [73] [74]. Teqball will make its debut at the 2025 SEA Games. During the first SEAGF council meeting for the 2025 SEA Games in June 2024, the organizing committee proposed hosting forty sports, and the member countries agreed to finalize a second shortlist for the sports programme. Dancesport, ju-jitsu, karate, kurash, soft tennis, and weightlifting were removed from the second shortlist [76] [77]. Kabaddi and roller skiing were initially expected to debut but were also removed from the second shortlist [78] [79] [80] [81] [82]. Polo (grouped with equestrian) and rugby sevens will make their return, having last been included in 2017. Baseball as well as softball, canoeing, and modern pentathlon will also return, having last been featured in 2019 [83]. Handball will return as well, having last been included in 2021 [84] [85]. Additionally, 3x3 basketball (grouped with basketball), kickboxing, snooker (grouped with billiards), and triathlon have been reinstated, having last been part of previous games. Furthermore, figure skating and short-track speed skating have been combined into a single ice skating group.. After the 2021 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games in Bangkok and Chonburi were cancelled on 20 August 2024 due to the organizers' failure to meet obligations, local athletes affected by the cancellation were given the chance to compete in other international tournaments, including the 2025 SEA Games. In September 2024, the sports programme was confirmed to include nine additional sports: ju-jitsu, karate, weightlifting, and wushu, all of which will be reinstated [86] [87] [88] [89]. Other sports added include bowling, chess (including makruk), cricket, extreme sports, and squash [90] [91] [92]. Extreme sports were group of sports climbing, skateboarding, waterskiing, and wakeboarding [93] [94]. Additionally, kabaddi and woodball were expected to make their debut at the event [95] [96].

Futsal was added to the football category, and chinlone was introduced as a variant of sepak takraw. Beach volleyball was recognized as part of the volleyball discipline. Later, in October 2024, jet skiing was included in the extreme sports group. Sports climbing and track cycling will make their return, having last been included in 2011 and 2017, respectively. BMX, rhythmic gymnastics, skateboarding, squash, waterskiing, and wakeboarding will also return, having last been featured in 2019. Bowling, chess, and futsal will make a comeback as well, with their last inclusion in 2021. Aerobic gymnastics, artistic gymnastics, beach volleyball, chinlone, cricket, dragon boat racing, jet skiing, mountain bike racing, road racing, and windsurfing have previously been part of past games. Kiteboarding and makruk will debut at these games..

## Design competition

The Sport Authority of Thailand (SAT) organized a design competition for the emblem, motto, and mascot for the 2025 SEA Games and the 2025 ASEAN Para Games. The submitted designs were required to be visually appealing, modern, unique, and reflect Thai identity. The submission period was from 20 September to 25 October 2023. The official awarding ceremony took place at the Chaloem Phrakiat Building at the Hua Mak Sports Complex in Bangkok on 23 November 2023 [116] [117]. 

## Emblem

The official emblem for the 2025 SEA Games, designed by Ruengwit Phutharaporn, was chosen through a nationwide contest. Inspired by the pla kat, or Siamese fighting fish—Thailand's national aquatic animal. In popular culture, the Siamese fighting fish has become an iconic symbol, featured in films like From Russia with Love, inspiring the famous iPhone 6s wallpaper, and even participating in a groundbreaking gaming experiment where a Betta fish completed Pokémon Sapphire, blending nature, art, and technology in innovative ways . In November 2024, the Design Subcommittee of the Thailand Creative Culture Agency (THACCA) under the National Soft Power Strategy Committee considered improving the logo to align with Thailand's soft power.

Notably, it bears a resemblance to the motto of the Asian Games, Ever Onward, which was established by Guru Dutt Sondhi, the founder of the games. . 

## Mascot

The official mascot for the 2025 SEA Games, designed by Tawich Jitthiang, was chosen through a nationwide contest.

The creature has the body of an elephant, with fish-like features such as fins along the backbone, leg fins attached to each of the four legs, and a fish tail. The name Mawin is derived from the Thai word for To Win. [128].
