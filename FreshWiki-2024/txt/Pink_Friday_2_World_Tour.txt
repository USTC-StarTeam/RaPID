Pink_Friday_2_World_Tour

The Pink Friday 2 World Tour (also known as the Gag City World Tour) was the fourth solo, and fifth overall, concert tour by Trinidadian rapper Nicki Minaj, in support of her fifth studio album Pink Friday 2 (2023). With a gross of over $108.8 million based on 70 shows, it is the highest-grossing concert tour by a female rapper and the fourth-highest-grossing tour by a rapper or hip hop artist in history.
Consisting of 79 shows across three continents, the Pink Friday 2 World Tour was the most extensive tour of Minaj's career. It began on March 1, 2024, in Oakland, California, and concluded on October 11, 2024, in Elmont, New York. It was her first concert tour in over five years, following The Nicki Wrld Tour (2019), and her first tour within North America in over nine years, with her previous being The Pinkprint Tour (2015). Monica was the supporting act for the first North American leg of the tour, while Bia, Tyga, and Skillibeng supported the second leg.

# Background

On June 29, 2023, Nicki Minaj announced her fifth studio album Pink Friday 2. The album was originally slated for release on October 20, 2023, but was eventually delayed to November 17 [6]. In her announcement, Minaj revealed that a concert tour supporting the album would begin "around the first quarter of 2024" [7]. During an Instagram live stream on October 11, she stated that the "approach" and "feel" of the tour would be "very different". She said: "This will be a very different feeling tour, even if you've been to every Nicki Minaj tour that's ever existed". In late October, she announced that the album's release was ultimately delayed to December 8, 2023;  and that details of the tour would be revealed on November 17 – the previously iterated release date of the album [8] [9]. On November 17, 2023, Minaj announced the Pink Friday 2 Tour and released a roster of 40 cities in the United States, Canada, and Europe that the tour would visit in 2024. A webpage on her website and Laylo, a fan engagement online platform, was made available for fans to sign up for the ticket presale [11]. Minaj's website crashed for a short time, minutes after her announcement [12]. She stated that "about  [thirty thousand]  [users]" were on the virtual queue of the sign-up page. Alec Ellin, CEO of Laylo, revealed via his social media that it "drove the single most site traffic we've ever seen at once" and "hundreds of thousands of fans" signed up within the first hour of the announcement [13]. The rapper revealed that dates, venues, and the ticket sale for the tour would be announced in December [14]. On December 7, Minaj announced the European tour dates via her Twitter account, beginning in May 2024 in Manchester. Presale for the European dates commenced exclusively to fans who signed up, on December 8, 2023 [16]. Tickets went on general public sale on December 15, 2023 [17]. On December 11, 2023, Minaj announced the US and Canada dates. The North American leg includes her headlining slots at the Rolling Loud California and Dreamville festivals in March and April 2024. Citi cardholders were granted presale access on December 12, followed by a Live Nation presale which was held on December 14 [19]. On December 14, second dates were added in Boston, Chicago, Amsterdam, and Manchester due to high demand [20] [21]. Public on-sale for the North America leg began on December 15 via Minaj's website and Ticketmaster [22]. A second Paris date was added on December 18; it went on sale the day after [18]. 13 more shows were announced on January 16, 2024 [23]. A Citi presale for the North American dates and a website presale for the European dates were held on January 16 and 17, before the general sale on January 19. In the following weeks, Minaj was announced as a headliner at nine festivals across Europe and North Africa [1]. [note 1] The nine slots were added as dates to the Europe and North African leg.On February 8, 2024, Monica announced on The Jennifer Hudson Show that she would serve as the opening act on the North American leg of the tour. On February 26, a date in Dublin was announced . Tickets for the show went on sale via Minaj's website on March 1, 2024. On May 24, 2024, Minaj announced a second US leg, including 22 additional dates in the country, beginning in September [35]. Fans were provided access to sign up for the ticket presale,  which took place on May 30, before the general sale the day after [36]. On May 25, Minaj was arrested in Amsterdam for suspicion of marijuana possession as she was about to board a plane for a concert in Manchester [37]. The Amsterdam arrest and brief detainment resulted in the tour's concert in Manchester's Co-op Live arena being rescheduled to June 3 [38] [39]. On May 31, Dutch concert organizer and promoter Mojo announced that the tour's second Amsterdam show—scheduled for June 2—had been canceled "due to the events of  [the previous week]" [38] [95]. On July 7, 2024, hours prior to her Saga Festival slot in Bucharest, Minaj announced its cancellation after having "been advised by  [her security team]  [not to travel to the city] due to safety concerns regarding protests in the area". Her decision to cancel the performance was heavily lampooned on social media, as no protest was scheduled for that day [42]. Instead, a protest of accountants against the government's fiscal policies was to take place the next day, following her departure from the country. Minaj was also criticized for the reason given which suggested Eastern Europe as a dangerous place [43]. On August 16, Minaj announced rappers Tyga, Bia, and Skillibeng as the supporting acts for the second US leg of the tour, subtitled "Gag City Reloaded". The leg contained an updated setlist and new wardrobe. Minaj also debuted music from the third and final deluxe version of Pink Friday 2, titled The Hiatus, released on December 13, 2024,  which was originally announced as Gag City Reloaded, during the trek [46] [47]. 

# Critical reception

The tour received highly positive reviews from critics, who praised the spectacle of the show and Minaj's overall dominance.. Reviewing the tour's opening night in Oakland, California, Gabe Meline wrote that "Nicki's resurrected herself," praising the rapper's performance after a period of controversy in the lead-up to the tour. The review highlighted the setlist's inclusion of both "smash hits and deep cuts" and Minaj's showcasing of the various sides of her persona, including "inspirational Nicki" and "sex-positive Nicki". Shawn Grant of The Source highlighted that "Minaj mesmerized over 25,000 fans at the Oakland Arena, setting a new record as the venue's second-highest-grossing single night by a hip-hop artist."  Melissa Ruggieri of USA Today reviewed her tour stop in Monday's Capital One Arena in Washington D.C., writing "Nicki Minaj delivers spectacle backed up by skill on biggest tour of her career," and stated that "Pink Friday 2 tour offers fans everything: Hits, deep cuts, attitude and lots of pink" and that "Still, Minaj is the Queen of Rap for a reason." [49] [50] [51]. Reggie Mathalone of the Houston Press claimed that the "production value under-promised and over-delivered," with the stage being a spectacle fit for Minaj and her promise of Gag City during the Houston, Texas show on May 9. Mathalone described that where the album truly delivers is "live stage with the incredible performance and production value" and that despite some hiccups, "Pink Friday 2, and all its special guests, are well worth the trouble." [52]. Hip-hop reporter Armon Sadler of Vibe reviewed Minaj's show in her hometown of New York City at Madison Square Garden, sharing " [she] gave her native New York crowd a night to remember", and that for Minaj, "there's no place like home". Sadler went on to claim that "There wasn't a single dry eye in the arena when Minaj belted "Save Me". You could not find a single silent person when she claimed her destiny on "Moment 4 Life", and later concluded that " [Nicki] has an undeniable love for her fans and a knack for putting on a fantastic concert". Evening Standard's Emma Loffhagen reviewed Minaj's London tour stop at The O2 Arena, sharing that when the show started, " [Nicki] was the slick image of confident professionalism" [53]. Loffhagen also stated that, "At times, the energy in the almost two-and-half hour show did sag slightly – some of the deeper and slower cuts felt a little lackluster in their delivery", and included the fact that "a whopping eight costume (and wig) changes to accommodate Minaj's famous alter egos interrupted the flow a little". However, Loffhagen concluded that when it comes to Minaj, "the Pink Friday 2 tour has proved she needn't worry about her crown shifting. No doubt the London Barbz were left sufficiently gagged". Dallas Observer's Vanessa Quilantan reviewed the Dallas, Texas show during the second leg of the tour, stating that throughout the show "the mood was high, the excitement was palpable and the vibe was convivial." Quilantan concluded that despite the late start " [Nicki] proved without a doubt last night at  [American Airlines Center] that pop culture absolutely needs entertainers like her." [60] [68].
