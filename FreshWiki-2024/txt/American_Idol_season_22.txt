# Auditions

The Idol Across America virtual auditions program returned. Remote auditions took place from August 2 to September 8, 2023, as well as a number of open-call auditions, and from these, the producers selected the contestants who were then invited to audition in front of the judges. Three locations were new, and selected due to them being hometowns of the judges: Leesburg (Bryan), Tuskegee (Richie), and Santa Barbara (Perry) [5]. The "platinum ticket" also returned from the previous two seasons. During the audition round, a total of three platinum tickets were awarded. The platinum ticket recipients were Odell Bunton Jr., Abi Carter, and Julia Gagnon. Carter ended up becoming the first "platinum ticket" recipient to win the series. .
