2024_United_States_Senate_elections

The 2024 United States Senate elections were held on November 5, 2024. Regularly scheduled elections were held for 33 out of the 100 seats in the U.S. Senate, and special elections were held in California and Nebraska. U.S. senators are divided into three classes whose six-year terms are staggered so that a different class is elected every two years. Class 1 senators faced election in 2024. Republicans flipped four Democratic-held seats, regaining a Senate majority for the first time in four years.
Twenty-six U.S. senators (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 2 independents) sought re-election in 2024, while seven senators declined to seek re-election. In addition, Sen. Laphonza Butler of California and Sen. George Helmy of New Jersey--each of whom had been appointed to their respective Senate seats--did not seek election in 2024. Concurrent with the 2024 regular Senate elections, two special Senate elections took place: One in California, to fill the final two months of Dianne Feinstein's term following her death in September 2023; and one in Nebraska, to fill the remaining two years of Ben Sasse's term following his resignation in January 2023. 
Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate by flipping an open seat in West Virginia; defeating Democratic incumbents in Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania; and retaining all the seats they had previously held. Republican gains were attributed to candidate quality and to the coattails of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who won the 2024 presidential election. Democratic candidates were elected in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin, despite Trump having won those states. No state in which Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won elected a Republican to the Senate.

# Partisan composition

All 33 Class 1 Senate seats, and one Class 2 seat, were up for election in 2024; where Class 1 currently consists of 20 Democrats, 4 independents who caucus with the Senate Democrats, [e] and 10 Republicans.. Burgess Everett of Politico considered the map for these Senate elections to be highly unfavorable to Democrats. Democrats were to  defend 23 of the 33 Class 1 seats,  including three in states won by Republican Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020 [20]. In contrast, there are no seats in this class held by Republicans in states won by Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. In the previous Senate election cycle that coincided with a presidential election (2020), only one senator (Susan Collins of Maine) was elected in a state that was simultaneously won by the presidential nominee of the opposite party. Republican gains were attributed to better candidate quality compared to 2022  and to the coattails of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who won the 2024 presidential election [22]. Time's Eric Cortellessa wrote that the thesis of the Republicans' success boiled down to the simple slogan "Max out the men and hold the women", meaning emphasizing the economy and immigration, which Trump did "relentlessly" [23]. Cortellessa also mentioned Trump's minimization of his numerous controversies, and push-offs of criminal trials via "a combination of friendly judges and legal postponements" to after the election. He said Trump's "advanced age and increasingly incoherent trail rhetoric" were taken by voters in stride, and that "much of the country read Trump's legal woes as part of a larger corrupt conspiracy to deny him, and them, power". NPR wrote that "Americans have continued to chafe at higher than pre-pandemic prices and the lack of affordable housing", and that much of the voter placed the blame "squarely" on the Biden administration, wishing for the economy that Trump established years ago . NPR said demographics played an important role, with White voters going up as a share of the electorate from 67% to 71% and the Republicans winning 46% of Latinos, and mentioned polling's "continued underestimation of Republicans's support nationally and in the key swing states".
