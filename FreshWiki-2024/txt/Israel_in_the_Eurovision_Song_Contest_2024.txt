Israel_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest_2024

Israel was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 with the song "Hurricane", written by Avi Ohayon, Keren Peles, and Stav Beger, and performed by Eden Golan. The Israeli participating broadcaster, the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation (IPBC/Kan), selected Golan as its entrant through the show HaKokhav HaBa (Rising Star), in collaboration with commercial broadcaster Keshet and Tedy Productions, while the song "Hurricane" was internally selected. The Israel–Hamas war impacted the production of the show and brought Israel's participation in the contest into controversy.
Israel was drawn to compete in the second semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 9 May 2024. Performing during the show in position 14, "Hurricane" was announced among the top 10 entries of the first semi-final and therefore qualified to compete in the final on 11 May. It was later revealed that Israel placed first out of the 16 participating countries in the semi-final with 194 points. In the final, Israel performed in position 6 and placed fifth out of the 25 participating countries, scoring 375 points.

# Background

Prior to the 2024 contest, the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) until 2017, and the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation (IPBC/Kan) since 2018, had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing Israel forty-five times since the IBA's first entry in 1973. They had won the contest on four occasions: in 1978 with the song "A-Ba-Ni-Bi" by Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta, in 1979 with the song "Hallelujah" by Milk and Honey, in 1998 with the song "Diva" by Dana International, and in 2018 with the song "Toy" by Netta [2]. Since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004, they had, to this point, managed to qualify to the final 12 times, achieving, besides its 2018 victory, four top ten results: in 2005 with "Hasheket Shenish'ar" by Shiri Maimon placing fourth, in 2008 with "The Fire in Your Eyes" by Boaz placing ninth, in 2015 with "Golden Boy" by Nadav Guedj placing ninth, and in 2023 with "Unicorn" by Noa Kirel placing third. As part of its duties as participating broadcaster, Kan organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country. On 5 June 2023, Kan confirmed its participation in the 2024 contest, announcing that its representative would return to be selected through the reality singing competition Rising Star, which had been used between 2015 and 2020. 

# Before Eurovision

## HaKokhav HaBa

As was the case between 2015 and 2020, the singer who would perform the Israeli entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 was selected through the reality singing competition HaKokhav HaBa, produced by Tedy Productions and Keshet Media Group, and broadcast on Keshet 12 as well as online via mako.co.il. The shows took place at the Neve Ilan Communications Center  [he] in Neve Ilan, and were hosted by Assi Azar and Rotem Sela. The judging panel for the competition was composed of Assaf Amdursky, Keren Peles, Shiri Maimon (2005 Israeli Eurovision entrant), Ran Danker, Itay Levi  [he] and Eden Hason. Preliminary casting rounds started in late July 2023   and ended on 10 September 2023 at Pavilion 2 of Expo Tel Aviv (Eurovision 2019 venue), where candidates were judged based on an a cappella performance of two songs of their choice [4] [5]. 

### Shows and impact of the Israel–Hamas war

Qualifiers from the preliminary casting phase proceeded to the auditions proper, held in Neve Ilan and originally set to be filmed in the presence of an audience from late September or early October 2023 and to begin airing in November 2023. However, following the outbreak of the Israel–Hamas war on 7 October 2023, filming for the competition was initially postponed in compliance with the Home Front Command's protection guidelines,   eventually beginning without an audience in the week between 16 and 22 October, with the broadcasts initially scheduled to start on 31 October [4] [5] [8] [8] [9]. The audience vote, which was set to determine 40% of the result alongside the judges, was replaced by the votes of a focus group [10] [11] [12]. On 31 October 2023, when it was planned to air, the broadcast of the first episode was postponed in order to commemorate two soldiers who had been killed in combat earlier that day. The decision to air the show in such circumstances was criticised by Israeli audiences and media,   and the broadcasts were ultimately rescheduled to start on 20 November [13] [14] [15] [16]. The second show, scheduled for 22 November,  was postponed to make room for a governmental press conference regarding a deal negotiated that day for the release of hostages held by Hamas;  broadcasting resumed on 2 December [17] [18] [19] [20]. Segments from the opening of the casting round of 10 September were included in the televised shows [21] [22]. The audition shows also included segments in support of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), and the very first contestant Shai Tamino, a member of the Education and Youth Corps band, performed wearing military fatigues;   this led some Eurovision fan media outlets to begin limiting their coverage of Israel's participation in the 2024 contest, on the grounds that it clashed with the non-political and pacifist values traditionally associated with the event [17] [19]. [a]. 

#### Auditions

Candidates were required to get a score of at least 70% of the votes from the judges and a focus group in order to advance.. 

#### Shortlisting round

The following phase, aired in segments on 31 December 2023, consisted of a shortlisting round, where the artists receiving a "yes" vote from all six judges automatically qualified and the others were chosen among those who had received four or five "yes" votes. 14 artists were shortlisted, namely Lian Biran, Eden Golan, Arik Sinai, Yehuda Saado, Shai Tamino, Ido Bartal, Mika Moshe, Jonathan Bitton, Mika Kertis, Dor Shimon, Or Cohen, Gal Kafri, Moria Angel, and Orel Ravid. 

#### Top 14 round

In the top 14 round, the votes of the judges and an audience determined one contestant to be eliminated from each show, ultimately coming down to the top five. In each of the first two shows and in the sixth show, the artist to be eliminated was the one getting the lowest overall score. In the third, fourth, seventh and ninth show, the artists were paired in duels, with the winners directly qualifying to the next round; the judges then selected one eliminee per show among the others. In the fifth show, the artists were coupled to perform duets, with the eliminee selected between the lowest scoring duo. In the eighth show, each contestant performed a duet with a surprise guest artist.. 

#### Semi-final round

In the first show of the semi-final, the votes of the judges and the audience determined one qualifier to the final. In the second show, the remaining four artists performed, and one of them left the competition.. 

#### Final

Following the semi-final, Israel drew "producer's choice" for the final, meaning that the country would perform in the half decided by the contest's producers. Israel was set to perform in position 6, following the entry from the Netherlands and before the entry from Lithuania; the Netherlands was later disqualified from the final, resulting in the entry from Luxembourg, which was set to perform in position 4, preceding Israel in the actual show [177]. Golan once again took part in dress rehearsals on 10 and 11 May before the final, including the jury final where the professional juries cast their final votes before the live show on 11 May [178]. She performed a repeat of their semi-final performance during the final on 11 May. Israel placed fifth in the final, scoring 375 points; 323 points from the public televoting and 52 points from the juries.. 

## Song selection

The song that Eden Golan would perform in the contest was internally selected by a professional committee. On 16 January 2024, Kan and Keshet opened a window for specially selected songwriters to submit their entries until 11 February; submissions were required to include lyrics in Hebrew. Golan also had the option to submit her own entry [52]. The selected entry, titled "Hurricane", was revealed on 10 March during a special broadcast on Kan 11, aired from the Yitzhak Rabin Center in Tel Aviv and hosted by Lior Suchard [51]. 

### Controversy

On 19 February 2024, a report by Israel Hayom claimed that the proposed entry for the contest was being written by Avi Ohayon  [he], Keren Peles, and Stav Beger, with it most likely being titled "October Rain". On 21 February, Ynet claimed that the EBU had rejected the entry on the grounds of political content in its lyrics, but that Kan was not planning to change the song or its content [57]. Kan and the EBU later addressed this report, stating that the song was being examined, and that if it did not meet the criteria, Kan would be given the opportunity to alter the lyrics or submit a new entry by 11 March [58]. However, Kan added that if it was asked to change the contents of the song, it would not do so, and be forced to withdraw from the contest [59] [60]. Miki Zohar, Culture and Sports Minister of Israel, called the intention of the EBU to reject the song "scandalous", and "called on the European Broadcasting Union to continue to act professionally and neutrally and not to let politics influence art";  he later expressed his support for the song to be altered in order to meet the criteria for the contest [61]. On 22 February 2024, Kan published the lyrics of "October Rain". Earlier that day, leaks by Israel Hayom and Ynet described the song as a ballad that builds up to a climax, referencing "the condition of Israeli civilians" in the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel and also alluding to the Nova music festival massacre [63]. On 28 February, Ynet reported that the song that finished second in the internal selection, "Dance Forever", written by Golan alongside Ron Biton  [he], May Sfadia, and Yinon Yahel, had also been rejected by the EBU,  On 3 March, Kan officially confirmed that it had submitted both "October Rain" and "Dance Forever" to the EBU for consideration, and that both had been rejected by the EBU in their current state [64] [65] [66]. Despite previous statements, Kan ultimately asked the writers of both songs to "make the necessary adjustments" in order for them to be eligible,  and announced that the final intended entry, "Hurricane" (reported to be a revision of "October Rain" with changed lyrics), had been recorded later that day [54]. However, the song's writers were reportedly asked to rewrite its lyrics again,  and the final version was submitted two days later [55] [67] [68]. The EBU gave its approval for the song on 7 March [56]. 

## Calls for exclusion

The humanitarian crisis resulting from Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip during the war led to calls for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to exclude Israel from the 2024 contest, with human rights activists urging other countries to boycott the event. Despite this, Israel ultimately appeared on the list of participants released by the EBU on 5 December 2023 [70] [71]. On 8 December, the EBU issued a statement maintaining that Kan "complies with all competition rules", allowing it to participate in 2024 [72]. The situation sparked controversy in a number of participating countries: [73] [74]. Petitions and letters requesting the EBU to exclude Israel were also signed by several former Eurovision entrants or intended entrants, including Ágústa Eva Erlendsdóttir (Iceland 2006 as Silvía Night), Malena Ernman (Sweden 2009), Eric Saade (Sweden 2011), Hatari (Iceland 2019), Ben Dolic (Germany 2020), Montaigne (Australia 2020 and 2021) and La Zarra (France 2023). [e] A letter advocating for Israel's continued inclusion was proposed by the Creative Community for Peace organisation; among the over 400 signatories to the letter are Scooter Braun, Harvey Mason Jr. and Helen Mirren. While not mentioning Israel's participation in the contest, on 29 March 2024, several entrants – namely Bambie Thug (Ireland), Gåte (Norway), Iolanda (Portugal), Megara (San Marino), Mustii (Belgium), Nemo (Switzerland), Olly Alexander (United Kingdom), Saba (Denmark), Silvester Belt (Lithuania) and Windows95man (Finland) – released a joint statement calling for "an immediate and lasting ceasefire" in Gaza, as well as the return of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas [125] [126]. Saade, who has Palestinian roots, criticised the EBU's handling of the matter as "disgraceful", and referred to the inclusion of Israel as "propaganda" [127] [128]. He further defended his presence as the opening act of the first semi-final "crucial" for Palestinian representation,  and upheld this by wearing a keffiyeh on his arm for his performance . A number of national selection events were disrupted by activists calling for a boycott in the lead-up to the event, including Norway's Melodi Grand Prix,  Spain's Benidorm Fest,  Sweden's Melodifestivalen,  Denmark's Dansk Melodi Grand Prix,  and Finland's Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu;  in addition, Dargen D'Amico and Ghali's statements calling for a ceasefire and an end to the "genocide" during their performances at Italy's Sanremo Music Festival caused public reactions by Italian broadcaster RAI and the Israeli ambassador to the country [131] [184] [133] [134] [135]. Demonstrations against Israeli participation also took place in the host city of Malmö,  with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu commenting that Golan had "already won" against what he referred to as a "horrible wave of antisemitism" in Sweden [136] [137]. Boycott campaigns, such as the BDS movement's Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI), as well as by LGBT organisations Queers in Palestine, Queers for Palestine and Queer Coalition for Palestine, argued that Israel's participation in the contest – widely regarded as an LGBT-inclusive event – was an attempt to "pinkwash", "whitewash" and "artwash" its apartheid policies and the "ongoing genocide" against Palestinians. [f] The repeated refusal of the EBU to discuss the issue of Israel's participation was also attributed by some to Moroccanoil, the main sponsor of the event since 2020, being an Israeli company. [g]. On 9 April 2024, the EBU released a statement by deputy director-general Jean Philip De Tender addressing "targeted social media campaigns" against participating artists, reportedly over the insufficient pressure put on the union to exclude Israel. De Tender stated that the inclusion of a country in the contest "is the sole responsibility of the EBU's governing bodies and not that of the individual artists", condemning abuse or harassment directed at the performers while also defending the rationale whereby Kan had been allowed to take part;  this was reiterated by the contest's executive supervisor Martin Österdahl in an interview with Dagens industri on 27 April [146]. A FAQ page on Israel's participation was additionally created on the official website of the contest [148]. 

# At Eurovision

The Eurovision Song Contest 2024 took place at the Malmö Arena in Malmö, Sweden, and consisted of two semi-finals held on the respective dates of 7 and 9 May and the final on 11 May 2024. All nations with the exceptions of the host country and the "Big Five" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) were required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete in the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progressed to the final. On 30 January 2024, an allocation draw was held to determine which of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show, each country would perform in; the EBU split up the competing countries into different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. At the request of Kan, Israel was allocated to the second semi-final as the rehearsal date for the first one coincides with Yom HaShoah;  the country was drawn to perform in the second half of the show [155] [156]. The shows' producers then decided the running order for the semi-finals; Israel was set to perform in position 14 [157]. In Israel, all three shows of the contest were broadcast on Kan 11, with commentary provided by Asaf Liberman  [he] and Akiva Novick  [he]; Yoav Tzafir  [he] joined them for the final. The final was also aired on radio via Kan 88, Kan Tarbut  [he] and Kan Bet  [he] [159] [161]. 

## Performance

Eden Golan took part in technical rehearsals on 30 April and 3 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 8 and 9 May. The staging of her performance of "Hurricane" at the contest is directed by Tzafir and Avichai Hacham, with five dancers accompanying the artist on stage and costumes designed by Alon Livne,    as well as the usage of a ring-shaped prop [165] [166] [167] [168]. Livne claimed that the organisers explicitly instructed him against using any symbolism that might have political references to "the situation in Israel", rejecting a number of costume proposals [169]. However, the chosen costumes have been said to resemble bandages, evoking thoughts of a hurt, wounded, and healing nation [168]. 

### Protest actions

Golan's performances throughout the contest were met with booing,    prompting Kan to file complaints to the EBU [171] [172] [173]. The EBU strove to keep any potentially politically coded messages out of the contest, but numerous other participants engaged in actions that were perceived as such, without directly criticising Israel's participation. ACOD-VRT, the internal socialist trade union of Flemish broadcaster VRT, aired a statement before and after the broadcast of the second semi-final and the final, denouncing Israel's human rights violations and accusing the country of "destroying freedom of the press" [174] [175]. 

## Semi-final

Israel performed in position 14, following the entry from Estonia and before the entry from Norway. At the end of the show, the country was announced as a qualifier for the final. [158]. 

## Final

Following the semi-final, Israel drew "producer's choice" for the final, meaning that the country would perform in the half decided by the contest's producers. Israel was set to perform in position 6, following the entry from the Netherlands and before the entry from Lithuania; the Netherlands was later disqualified from the final, resulting in the entry from Luxembourg, which was set to perform in position 4, preceding Israel in the actual show [177]. Golan once again took part in dress rehearsals on 10 and 11 May before the final, including the jury final where the professional juries cast their final votes before the live show on 11 May [178]. She performed a repeat of their semi-final performance during the final on 11 May. Israel placed fifth in the final, scoring 375 points; 323 points from the public televoting and 52 points from the juries.. 

## Voting

Below is a breakdown of points awarded to and by Israel in the second semi-final and in the final. Voting during the three shows involved each country awarding sets of points from 1–8, 10 and 12: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting in the final vote, while the semi-final vote was based entirely on the vote of the public. The Israeli jury consisted of Yaron Ashbel, Shlomit Dersso, Maya Opal Drukman, Kobi Marimi (who represented Israel in 2019), and May Sfadia [179]. In the second semi-final, Israel placed first with 194 points, receiving the maximum twelve points from Albania, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the Rest of the World vote [180]. In the final, Israel placed fifth with 375 points, receiving twelve points from Australia, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the Rest of the World in the televote.. Public votes for Israel were boosted by a campaign by Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Advertising Office, which featured Golan asking for support in French, Italian, Spanish, German, Czech, Latvian, Estonian, Albanian, Georgian and English. The campaign stated, "In light of the wave of hatred and Muslim demonstrations in Malmö, a counter-reaction by the silent majority is taking place. Europeans don't like what their eyes see." [181]. Over the course of the contest, Israel awarded its 12 points to Armenia in the second semi-final, and to Luxembourg in both the jury and televote in the final. Kan appointed Maya Alkulumbre  [he] as its spokesperson to announce the Israeli jury's votes in the final. 

### Detailed voting results

Each participating broadcaster assembles a five-member jury panel consisting of music industry professionals who are citizens of the country they represent. Each jury, and individual jury member, is required to meet a strict set of criteria regarding professional background, as well as diversity in gender and age. No member of a national jury was permitted to be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member as well as the nation's televoting results were released shortly after the grand final. [185]. The following members comprised the Israeli jury: [180].
