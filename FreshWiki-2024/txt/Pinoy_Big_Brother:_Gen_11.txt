Pinoy_Big_Brother:_Gen_11

The eleventh season of the reality game show Pinoy Big Brother, subtitled Gen 11 (short for Generation 11), premiered on the Kapamilya Channel for 99 days from July 20 to October 26, 2024.
This is the seventh consecutive season in which both civilian adults and teenagers participated in a season, using a similar format of both All In and Connect seasons to house them together as a single batch. This is also the first season in the entire series to feature all-female finalists, and the third season to be dominated by teen housemates, following the Lucky 7 and Connect seasons. This season is tied with Connect as the shortest special season produced by the series to date.
Fyang Smith emerged as the winner of the season against runner-up Rain Celmar. Kolette Madelo and Kai Montinola finished in third and fourth place, respectively. Smith became the latest late-entrant housemate in a special season to win the season, following Daniel Matsunaga of All In, and Liofer Pinatacan of Connect, and the third and latest teen housemate to win in a special season and the seventh teen overall to win in the series, following Maymay Entrata of Lucky 7 and Jimboy Martin of 737.

# Development

A new season of Pinoy Big Brother was confirmed on December 13, 2023, during the ABS-CBN Christmas Special that presented the network's program line-up for 2024. The season, the first to air in two years, is subtitled Gen 11, emphasizing the season's focus on housemates from Generation Z [3] [4]. ABS-CBN Television Production Head Unit and Head Director Laurenti Dyogi initially confirmed that the season would premiere in June [5]. However, the season's premiere date moved to July 20 [6] [7] [8]. 

## Auditions

On April 6, Dyogi announced that Star Hunt will oversee the casting process for the upcoming season along with auditions for Star Magic and aspiring Star Hunt Academy trainees, beginning with on-ground auditions in Metro Manila, and then in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao in the following weeks. Auditions were also held abroad ahead of the season's announcement [8]. Auditions for Gen 11 officially began on April 27 and marked the return of physical auditions after it was halted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines during the past two seasons. Like in previous seasons, the auditions for adult and teen housemates (ages 16–32) were held simultaneously. Online auditions began on May 29, and ended on June 16, 2024. A total of 35,906 auditioned for this season, with 20,157 coming from on-site auditions via Star Hunt and 15,749 coming through online auditions. Among them, 67 were selected for the final casting. 

### False casting calls

In April 2024, netizens reported unauthorized audition calls that falsely claimed to be open casting calls for ABS-CBN shows such as Pinoy Big Brother, FPJ's Batang Quiapo, and Senior High's sequel, High Street, that were widely circulated on social media. In response, ABS-CBN issued an advisory on April 16, 2024, to debunk the misleading casting calls and advise the public to be vigilant against scammers falsely representing themselves as part of the show's production. 

## Timeslot

The show airs at 10:15 p.m. (PST) every weeknights after Pamilya Sagrado, 8:30 p.m. (Kapamilya Channel, Kapamilya Online Live, A2Z and TV5) on Saturdays, and at 8:30 p.m. (Kapamilya Channel, Kapamilya Online Live and A2Z) and 9:30 p.m. (TV5) on Sundays after Rainbow Rumble. This season, a daily 30-minute highlights show airs Monday through Friday, with a one-hour live eviction show on Saturday and nominations show revealed on Sunday.. On October 28, 2024, this show was replaced by The Untamed on weeknights while on November 2, 2024, this show was replaced by Mega Blockbusters on weekends.. 

# Overview

## Logo

The logo for Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11 features significant changes from the logos used in past seasons. The logo's eye is identical to that used on the tenth season, which features gradients inspired by the colors of the Philippine flag, but slants rightward. The text Pinoy Big Brother also slants rightward and has a gradient spanning shades of blue and red. The season's subtitle Gen 11 is featured below with a white neon color. Below the text is an outline of a house in neon light.. 

## House

The house's façade was repainted in yellow and blue, and four LED screens were installed on the windows; the other façade (also known as House B in Double Up including the activity area) was demolished in May 2023 due the expiration of its lease. The interior of the house has been updated, repainted, and furnished with a video-game theme [16]. Mural paintings by Polido Mural Arts adorn the walls. The living area prominently displays a large version of the current graphical eye's logo, along with pixelated art of José Rizal, the GomBurZa, and Melchora Aquino. The translated lyrics of the show's theme song are also displayed in various Filipino languages. In the pool area, a mural featuring the lyric "Oh Shux!" from the 2023 song "Pantropiko" by the P-pop girl group Bini, along with pixelated clouds and trees, adds to the theme. The confession room has been repainted and renovated, now featuring sofa "blocks.". 

## Hosts

Bianca Gonzalez, Robi Domingo, Kim Chiu, Melai Cantiveros, and Enchong Dee, collectively known as Pamilya ni Kuya (lit. 'Big Brother's family'), reprised their roles as the main hosts of the season. This is the first full season without Toni Gonzaga as the main host since the inception of the Philippine franchise in 2005. On June 20, 2024, former Kumunity 10 celebrity housemate Alexa Ilacad was named one of the presenters for the season and its digital companion shows [17]. 

## Livestream

Every day from 8:00 a.m. until 12:00 a.m., viewers can watch the show live on the e-commerce app Lazada through LazLive. There are four distinct live streams available for viewers to choose from: the main stream, which will showcase the entire house, the dining area, the living room, and the pool area. 

## Sponsorships

The show has partnered with the following products and services: mobile payment app Maya, which serves as the season's official finance and voting partner; Unilever beauty products Cream Silk and Pond's; soft drink brand Coca-Cola; and e-commerce app Lazada, which serves as the official e-commerce and shopping application and also provides the show's livestream via the Lazada app. All these products have product placements inside the house. 

## Companion shows

This season has a digital companion show called PBB Gen 11 Up, hosted by Alexa Ilacad, Enchong Dee, Melai Cantiveros, Kim Chiu and Robi Domingo and airs every Saturday at 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. and can be viewed on Kapamilya Online Live via Facebook and YouTube. 

## Theme songs

This season's theme song is a remix of the original theme song "Pinoy Ako" by the band Orange and Lemons, modified to match the season's theme, reverting back from the newer "Pinoy Tayo" by Rico Blanco used in the previous season. Meanwhile, the eviction theme song is "Huwag Muna Tayong Umuwi" (lit. 'let's not go home yet') by Bini, from their sophomore album Feel Good (2022).. 

## Prizes

The winner received ₱1,000,000, and a house and lot from Vista Land. Meanwhile, the second, third, and fourth "big placers" received ₱500,000, ₱300,000, and ₱200,000, respectively. All finalists also received an all-expense paid trip to South Korea for two from Mitzy Travel & Tours worth ₱200,000, and a three-month endorsement contract with Lazada as "LazAffiliate Ambassadors" worth ₱400,000.. 

# Format

Every week, each housemate must nominate two other housemates for eviction, with the first receiving two points and the second receiving one. The top three (or more if there is a tie) housemates with the most nomination points will be put forward for public vote. Furthermore, Big Brother has the authority to grant immunity or an automatic nomination to a housemate, primarily due to twists or violations. A nomination round may be paused due to pending tasks, challenges, or twists.. 

# Housemates

Leading up to the series premiere, five people were introduced daily from July 15 to 19, 2024, on Star Hunt: The Audition Show. Fourteen housemates entered the house on launch night (July 20), including two-in-one housemates Dingdong Bahan and Patrick Ramirez [24] [25]. Five additional housemates moved in over the next few weeks: Jan Silva and Fyang Smith on Day 16 (August 4); Joli Alferez and JP Cabrera on Day 24 (August 12), and Gwen Montano on Day 33 (August 21) [26]. Montano and Alferez were later merged as a single housemate on Day 34 (August 22), becoming the next two-in-one housemates after Bahan and Ramirez [27]. A total of twenty people entered the house, with sixteen competing as individuals and four as pairs, which counted as two two-in-one housemates. This brings the housemate count to eighteen.. 

# Houseguests

Big Brother may invite guests, physically or virtually, to his house for special occasions.. 

# Tasks

## Weekly tasks

Big Brother will assign weekly tasks to the housemates each week to test their group dynamics, cooperation, and camaraderie. Beginning with the second weekly task, the housemates who successfully finish their weekly task will receive ₱30,000 as their budget through Maya. From there, they can choose to either spend their weekly budget or save it and watch it grow through the Save or Spend Weekly Task twist, which offers an interest rate of up to 15% (growing up to ₱200,000).. 

## Other tasks

In addition to the weekly tasks, Big Brother has the authority to assign additional ones. These tasks are divided into four categories: daily, which are regular tasks that housemates can complete and assign to one another; secret, which require a housemate to complete the task in secret without informing the other housemates; reward, which can apply to the three types and must be completed by the assigned housemate(s) in order to receive the reward; and special, which are special tasks imposed by Big Brother or the housemates themselves with Big Brother's approval. Punishment tasks are also listed here for transparency, and they are considered separately from the four types.. Depending on the outcome, some tasks may have the potential to influence the activities inside the House, to much extent the competition between the housemates. In some cases, the show's sponsors may sponsor specific tasks, and the housemates can receive luxury rewards through a luxury competition, task, or challenge.. 

## House Challenger tasks

On Day 71, Big Brother introduced the 'House Challenger' twist, where evicted housemates or selected individuals were tasked with creating chaos and testing the authenticity and integrity of the remaining housemates. This twist aimed to help the public determine who should advance to the Big Four. For this season, Big Brother brought back four evicted housemates: Therese Villamor; the two-in-one housemates, Dingdong Bahan and Patrick Ramirez; Jas Dudley-Scales; and Jarren Garcia, who had been evicted earlier that day after receiving the lowest percentage of public votes to save. However, Jarren returned as a house challenger.. The table below outlines the tasks assigned to the five house challengers.. 

## The Big Task

On Day 94 (October 21), Big Brother officially introduced the "Big Task," the third and final twist in the larger "Big Payanig" twist, which aims to help the public determine the housemate most deserving of the title "Big Winner." For this season, Big Brother employed an artificial intelligence assistant named "Madam," whose role was to "assist Big Brother in his daily tasks." However, Madam's true function was to reveal the remaining housemates' true personalities. During the "Big 4 Tapatan" (Big 4 Face-Off) held the day before on Day 93 (October 20), host Bianca Gonzalez asked the four finalists to identify the housemate they believed best exemplified a key trait of a Big 4 finalist: Rain was chosen as the "pinaka-matalino" (most intelligent), Kai as "pinaka-madiskarte" (most strategic), Kolette as "pinaka-maalaga" (most caring), and Fyang as "pinaka-maaasahan" (most reliable). Madam would later assign tasks based on these traits, serving as a test of their integrity and character. Before Madam was introduced to the housemates, Big Brother gave letters to the finalists, informing them that they would be separated until further notice. Rain was assigned to stay in the task room, Kai in the boys' bedroom, Kolette in the living area, and Fyang in the girls' bedroom. During the period when Madam was present in the house, Big Brother was notably absent, as evidenced by the lack of response when the four finalists entered the confession room. Below are the tasks assigned by "Madam" on behalf of Big Brother.. 

# Challenges

## Group challenges

As in previous seasons, the housemates were divided into multiple teams to compete for immunity on various occasions.. 

## Ligtask

Carried over from the previous season, nominees would face challenges to ensure their safety from the impending eviction.. 

## House challenges

The housemates and house challengers will compete in a series of team challenges designed by Big Brother to test their camaraderie and teamwork. The outcome of each challenge may significantly influence who remains and who leaves as the final approaches. The battle between housemates and challengers officially began on Day 76 (October 3).. Legend:. 

## The Big Love

On Day 87 (October 14), Big Brother invited the loved ones of the remaining five housemates into the house. This twist, called "The Big Love," the second of the three major twists within the larger "Big Payanig" twist, first revealed on Day 78. "The Big Love" seeks to push the housemates' feelings to the limit and put them through even more emotional testing.. For this challenge, each housemate, together with their loved one, will compete in three "Big Love" elimination rounds. The winning pair at the end of the challenges will receive a cash prize of one hundred thousand pesos (₱100,000) that will be deducted from their Maya savings account (which in turn is derived from their Save or Spend Weekly Task twist; see twists), and an all-expense paid trip to Boracay for four courtesy of Mitzy Travel & Tours. At the end of each challenge, each pair will be given 100 seconds to interact and say their goodbyes, and the housemate representative will receive a gift.. The following are the names of the loved ones of the five remaining housemates, arranged in alphabetical order by the housemates' names:. 

# Nomination history

Each nomination table cell indicates two points to the first housemate named and one point to the second housemate named.. Fyang Smith, the winner of this season has the most nomination points by a winner with 56 nomination points, surpassing the record of Anji Salvacion of the previous season with 25 nomination points.. Color key:. 

## Special nomination processes

In certain instances, Big Brother may implement a special nomination process during a nomination round, replacing the usual private nominations in the confession room. Typically, these alternative nomination processes are conducted face-to-face and are seldom private.. 

### Contribution nominations

On Day 74 (October 1), the seven remaining housemates voted face-to-face for two housemates they believed had made the most significant contributions (ambag) in the house. Each vote counted as one point, as shown in the table below. The top two housemates with the highest votes were deemed safe from the upcoming challenges against the house challengers and would return to the main house. Meanwhile, the five unchosen housemates, who had been staying outside for a week as part of the challenge, had to face two challenges against the house challengers. Those unchosen were at risk of losing their housemate status to the challengers.. At the end of the nomination process, with a vote tally of 7-4-1-1-1-0-0, Binsoy and JM were declared safe from the challenges against the house challengers and were granted re-entry into the house. Meanwhile, Fyang, JP, Kai, Kolette, and Rain were left to face the house challengers, where they had to defend their housemate status. 

### Rank-based nominations

On Day 81 (October 8), the six remaining housemates ranked themselves, including each other, based on who they believed deserved to be the season's Big Winner, with first place being the most deserving and sixth place the least. The total points each housemate received determined the final ranking and the nominees for the week, with the top three housemates with the most points facing eviction. The initial rankings were made in the confession room, and any final adjustments were completed in the garden area if a housemate decided to change their ranking. On Day 82 (October 9), a face-to-face nomination was held where housemates' self-rankings were revealed. However, the results were only made public the previous day, along with the final rankings, after which public voting commenced.. The underlined names below represent the rankings the housemates assigned to themselves. 

## S-E voting system results

The Save-Evict voting method was discontinued after the seventh eviction round, and only the original vote-to-save method was used beginning with the eighth eviction round.. 

# Big Night

The season finale, dubbed The Final Stage at The Big Night was simultaneously held on October 26, 2024 at ABS-CBN Studio 10 and Dolphy Theatre in Quezon City. It included performances from past Big Winners James Reid from Teen Clash 2010, Maymay Entrata from Lucky 7, and Anji Salvacion from Kumunity Season 10, 737 Teen finalist Bailey May, and former housemates Joshua Garcia from All In, Jameson Blake from 737 Adult batch, and Seth Fedelin from Otso Batch 1. During their performance, hosts Melai Cantiveros, Enchong Dee, and Alexa Ilacad joined them, along with the evicted housemates from this season. [121]. At the end of the night, Kai Montinola was declared the fourth Big Placer with 17.38% of the total public vote, followed by Kolette Madelo in third place with 25.91%, and Fyang Smith as the season's winner with 30.66% of the total public vote, ahead of Rain Celmar, who was ranked second with 26.05%.. 

# Reunion

In conclusion to the Big Night, a special episode dubbed Aba, Ayos! Ang Pagtatapos: The Reunion Special (lit. 'Well, Nice! The Ending: The Reunion Special') featured the reunion of the former housemates (with the exception of Noimie, who was abroad at the time of the season's finale) and the finalists on October 27, 2024.. This season, the Uber-Acting segment returned, with the hosts re-enacting three of the season's most iconic moments. First, Melai portrayed Brx in the "tocino" incident, while Robi and Enchong took on the roles of two-in-one housemates Dingdong and Patrick. Next, Alexa and Melai re-enacted the intense Rap Battle task between Jas and Fyang, with Robi and Enchong making non-speaking cameos as JM and Dylan. Finally, the face-off between housemates and house challengers was brought to life by Robi as JM, Melai as Therese and Kolette, Alexa as Kai, and Bianca as Fyang.. 

# Spin-off

A spin-off reality series titled Pinoy Big Brother: Gen 11 Big 4 Ever has been commissioned following the immense success of the season. It premiered on December 9, 2024, on Kapamilya Channel, Kapamilya Online Live, A2Z, TV5, iWantTFC and TFC that features this season's housemates. Hosted by Robi Domingo and Bianca Gonzalez, the series delved into discussions with the housemates, showcase their lives after the show, and present never-before-seen footage that was not aired during the season. This marks the second reality spin-off in the franchise since Melason in Love from the Double Up season in 2010. 

# Reception

Due to the season's high engagement with viewers and fans on various social media platforms, a huge number of violent remarks and bashing towards the housemates concerned the show, prompting the release of an official statement from the management to take legal actions on such matters, as well as the removal of the vote-to-evict system during the seventh eviction round. On the other hand, this season has also received a lot of positive reception from the viewers, resulting in a lot of concurrent viewers during major episodes,   with 2.26 million all-time high peak concurrent viewers during the Big Night,  which also received an all-time high TV rating of 10.0% on October 26, 2024, according to the Nielsen NUTAM People Survey [125] [126].
