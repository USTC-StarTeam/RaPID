2024_National_League_Division_Series

The 2024 National League Division Series (NLDS) were two best-of-five playoff series in Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2024 postseason to determine the participating teams of the 2024 National League Championship Series (NLCS). These matchups are:

(1) Los Angeles Dodgers (NL West champions) vs. (4) San Diego Padres (Wild Card Series winner). Dodgers win the series, 3–2.
(2) Philadelphia Phillies (NL East champions) vs. (6) New York Mets (Wild Card Series winner). Mets win the series, 3–1.
The team with the better regular season record (higher seed) of each series hosts Games 1, 2, and (if necessary) 5, while the lower seeded team hosts Games 3 and 4.
The Dodgers would go on to defeat the New York Mets in the NLCS 
and then win the World Series over the Mets fellow Subway Series rival New York Yankees.

# Background

The top two division winners (first two seeds) are determined by regular season winning percentages. The final two teams are the winners of the National League Wild Card Series, played between the league's third to sixth-seeded teams.. The Los Angeles Dodgers (98–64) clinched their 12th consecutive postseason berth on September 19, won the National League West and first-round bye on September 26, and clinched the best record in both NL and MLB on September 28, giving them home-field advantage through the World Series. With their 12th consecutive postseason appearance, the Dodgers currently hold the longest active playoff streak in major North American professional sports [3] [4] [5]. They played  the San Diego Padres (93–69), who qualified for the postseason as the fourth seed wild card entrant. They swept the fifth-seeded Atlanta Braves in the Wild Card Series for the Padres to return to the NLDS for the third time in the past five seasons. San Diego won the season series against Los Angeles, 8–5, and it was the first time the Padres won a season series against their rivals since 2010 (which is also the last year they won 90 games). This was a continuation of the Dodgers-Padres rivalry and the third postseason meeting between the two teams [6]. Their previous playoff meetings were in the 2020 NLDS and the 2022 NLDS in which the Dodgers swept the former series and the Padres won the latter series in one of the biggest upsets in postseason history. This was the fifth straight year for an all-National League West match-up in the NLDS. [A]. The Philadelphia Phillies (95–67) clinched a postseason berth on September 20, won the National League East on September 23, and clinched a first-round bye on September 25     The Phillies are making their third straight postseason and it represented their first appearance as NL East champions since 2011 [8] [9] [10]. They played the New York Mets (89–73), who qualified for the postseason as the sixth-seed wild card entrant due to their head-to-head record versus the Atlanta Braves, the team they finished tied with. New York, who was 11 games under .500 at one point in the season, is the third straight sixth seed to make it out of the Wild Card series round in the National League. They did this by defeating the Milwaukee Brewers in three games, thanks in part to a Pete Alonso three-run home run in the top of the ninth inning that gave the Mets the lead and eventual series-win. The Mets advanced to the NLDS for the first time since their pennant season of 2015. The Phillies won the season series over the Mets, 7–6. This was the first postseason meeting of the Phillies and Mets, who have been rivals since the creation of the Mets franchise in 1962 but have had mutual winning seasons only ten times in 63 years of co-existence [11]. This was also the third straight year the NLDS featured an all-National League East match-up, with the Braves versus Phillies occurring in 2022 and 2023. [12].

Edwin Díaz closed the game for his first postseason save as the Mets advanced to their first NLCS since their 2015 pennant season [44]. The victory also marked the first time that the Mets clinched a playoff series at Citi Field. 

## Game 5

This was just the fourth winner-take-all postseason game in San Diego's history (their third in just five seasons) and Los Angeles' 17th such game (including their time in Brooklyn). Game 5 marked the first matchup between two Japanese-born starting pitchers (Yu Darvish and Yoshinobu Yamamoto) in the history of the Major League Baseball postseason. In the bottom of the second, Enrique Hernández hit a solo home run off Darvish to put the Dodgers on the board 1–0 [38]. Yamamoto allowed only two hits and one walk in five scoreless innings. In the bottom of the seventh, Teoscar Hernández hit a solo home run off Darvish to extend the Dodgers' lead to 2–0.
