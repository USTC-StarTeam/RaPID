# Overview

The 2025 PDC World Darts Championship was the 32nd World Darts Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation, and the 18th to be held at Alexandra Palace in London, England. It took place from 15 December 2024 to 3 January 2025. The championship featured 96 participants, with the top 32 highest ranked players on the PDC Order of Merit being seeded through to the second round. The 32 qualifiers from the Pro Tour Order of Merit and the 32 other players from various qualifiers start in the first round. Irish gambling company Paddy Power continued their sponsorship of the event, having agreed a three-year contract with the PDC ahead of the 2024 edition. As part of its promotion of the event, Paddy Power announced 'The Bigger 180' campaign, for which the bookmaker would, as last year, donate £1,000 to charity Prostate Cancer UK for every maximum score of 180 achieved during the tournament, while also introducing a £180,000 bonus for a nine-dart finish hit at the tournament, shared equally between the charity, the player, and a fan in the Alexandra Palace crowd [4]. Going into the event, the previous year's finalists were viewed by bookmakers as the tournament favourites with Luke Littler having won the Premier League,    the World Series Finals,  and the Grand Slam of Darts,   and defending champion Luke Humphries having won the World Matchplay   and the Players Championship Finals [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [69] [13] [14]. 

## Format

All matches were played as straight in (player begins scoring with their first throw no matter what section is hit), double out (a segment on the outer ring or the bullseye), requiring the players to score 501 points to win a leg, finishing on a double. The matches were played in the set format, with a minimum of three sets required to win a match. The following rules are observed: [16]. 

## Ranking

The rankings on the PDC Order of Merit were calculated on a two-year basis. Players who participated in the 2023 PDC World Darts Championship were defending their prize money from that event on their ranking. At the end of the tournament, the PDC Order of Merit prize money from that event was deleted from their ranking. After the tournament, the top 64 in the PDC Order of Merit received a one-year extension on their tour card. Players in the final year of their tour card, or that do not hold a tour card for the 2024 season, who finished the tournament outside the top 64 lost their tour card, unless players inside the top 64 resign their tour card, which Steve Beaton is expected to do. 

## Prize money

The total prize pool for the tournament remained at £2.5 million in total for the seventh year in a row. Tournament sponsors Paddy Power pledged a £60,000 bonus for a nine-dart finish hit during the tournament to each of the players, Prostate Cancer UK, and a fan in the Alexandra Palace crowd during the match it was hit [2] [3]. Christian Kist hit a nine-darter in his first round match against Madars Razma [5] [6]. Damon Heta hit the second nine-darter of the tournament in his third round match against Luke Woodhouse. [18] [19].

# Summary

## Opening rounds

The tournament began on 15 December, with defending champion Luke Humphries defeating Frenchman Thibault Tricole 3–0 in his opening match. Second seed and former champion Michael Smith became the highest-ranked player to fail to make it through the second round, losing 3–2 to Kevin Doets [98]. Smith was one of four former world champions not to win their opening match, being joined by Rob Cross, who lost 3–1 to Scott Williams,  Gary Anderson who was beaten 3–0 by Jeffrey de Graaf  and Raymond van Barneveld who lost 3–1 to Nick Kenny [99] [26] [109]. Two major champions from the 2024 season also failed to win a match, 2024 World Grand Prix winner Mike De Decker being beaten by Luke Woodhouse  and 2024 European Champion Ritchie Edhouse losing 3–1 to Ian White,  with White himself having received a walkover victory over Sandro Eric Sosing in the first round after the Filipino withdrew with ill health [102] [109]. In total, 14 seeds were eliminated in the second round, a record for the tournament; in addition to Michael Smith, Cross, Anderson, Van Barneveld, De Decker and Edhouse, Dave Chisnall, Danny Noppert, James Wade, Ross Smith, Martin Schindler, Dirk van Duijvenbode, Gabriel Clemens and Gian van Veen all lost their first game. Former world champions to win their opening match, in addition to Humphries, were Michael van Gerwen who defeated James Hurrell 3–0, Peter Wright who knocked out Wesley Plaisier 3–1 and Gerwyn Price who beat Keane Barry 3–0. The highest average of the tournament, was thrown by Callan Rydz in his first round victory over Romeo Grbavac, hitting a three dart average of 107.06; Rydz would go on to defeat Martin Schindler to make the third round. In his first round defeat to Madars Razma, Christian Kist hit the first nine-dart finish at the World Championship since the 2023 tournament's final. 

## Third round

Callan Rydz continued to average highly in the third round, averaging 105.31 in a 4–0 win over 2024 UK Open champion Dimitri Van den Bergh. Ninth-seed Damon Heta was eliminated by a 4–3 scoreline to Luke Woodhouse, being the highest seed to be eliminated in this round despite being the second player to throw a nine-dart finish in the championship [106]. Rydz and Woodhouse were two of seven unseeded players to make it to the fourth round, along with Ryan Joyce, Ricardo Pietreczko, Kevin Doets, Jeffrey de Graaf and Robert Owen [127]. Former world champion Gerwyn Price kept his hopes of regaining his crown alive with a victory over Joe Cullen, having to come through a deciding leg in the final set despite having previously held a 3–0 lead. Reigning champion Luke Humphries defeated Nick Kenny,  with former world champions Michael van Gerwen  and Peter Wright,  and pre-tournament favourite Luke Littler also winning their third round matches [108] [109] [110] [109]. 

## Fourth round

Reigning champion Luke Humphries's campaign ended in the fourth round after he was defeated 4–1 by Peter Wright. Wright's fellow former world champions also qualified, with Gerwyn Price knocking out fellow Welshman Jonny Clayton 4–2  and Michael van Gerwen eliminated Jeffrey de Graaf by the same scoreline [106] [106]. Callan Rydz was the only unseeded player to reach the quarter-final, beating Robert Owen 4–3 to reach the second quarter final of his career [111]. Two other matches went the full seven sets, Luke Littler defeating Ryan Joyce to reach his second quarter-final from two attempts and Chris Dobey beating Kevin Doets to get through the fourth round for the third consecutive year. The remaining matches were won by scorelines of 4–0, with 2024 Masters champion Stephen Bunting eliminating Luke Woodhouse and Nathan Aspinall conquering a distinctly below-par Ricardo Pietreczko. 

## Quarter-finals

The quarter-finals were held on New Year's Day 2025. Chris Dobey played Gerwyn Price in the first quarter-final. Price won the first two sets before Dobey took control, winning four sets in a row to go one away. Price won the seventh set after Dobey missed five darts to win the match, but Dobey won the eighth set 3–1 to qualify for the first world championship semi-final of his career. In the second quarter-final Michael van Gerwen played Callan Rydz. After five sets, which were all won by the player throwing first, Van Gerwen held a 3–2 lead, before breaking Rydz's throw in the third leg of the sixth set on his way to a 3–1 victory in that set to go two sets up. Rydz, who had earlier missed a dart to win the fifth set, managed to win the seventh set against the Van Gerwen throw, but missed two darts in the deciding leg of the eighth set, allowing Van Gerwen to win that set and the match to qualify for the world championship semi-final for the ninth time of his career. Stephen Bunting played Peter Wright in the third quarter-final. Bunting won the first four sets, including winning the fourth set 3–0 against the throw, before Wright came back and won sets five and six. Bunting secured the match victory with a 3–0 win in the seventh set to reach the second PDC world championship semi-final of his career. In the final quarter-final Luke Littler took on Nathan Aspinall. Littler got off to a strong start, winning the first set with three consecutive twelve-darters, and took the second set against the Aspinall throw. Aspinall broke back in the third set, but a Littler eleven-darter in the deciding leg of the fourth set restored the two-set advantage. Littler won the fifth set to go one away, and while Aspinall did manage to take the sixth set, another 3–0 scoreline in the seventh set ensured Littler would qualify for the semi-final for the second consecutive year. 

## Semi-finals

In the first semi-final, Michael van Gerwen played Chris Dobey. Van Gerwen won the first set against the throw, and took advantage of three missed darts from Dobey to also take the second. Dobey got off the mark with a 3–0 win in the third set, including a 170 checkout in the second leg, but Van Gerwen won the fourth set by the same scoreline to re-gain the two set advantage before breaking in the fifth set. Van Gerwen took the next two sets to complete a 6–1 victory to reach his seventh world championship final. Luke Littler took on Stephen Bunting in the other semi-final. Littler won the first set 3–2, before breaking in second set 3–1. The same 3–2, 3–1 pattern was repeated in the next two sets, giving Littler a 4–0 lead. Bunting broke back the fifth set with a 3–1 win, but missed 3 to win the sixth set, which Littler won 3–2 to go one away. With a 3–1 win in the seventh set Littler also completed a 6–1 win to reach the world championship final for the second time.
