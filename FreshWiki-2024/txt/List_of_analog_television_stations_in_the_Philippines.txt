This is a list of analog television stations in the Philippines. Currently, there are two major networks competing for bigger audience share; GMA Network Inc. and TV5 Network, Inc. and three government-owned networks; People's Television Network Inc., Radio Philippines Network Inc. and Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation. Most free-to-air networks are popularly known by their flagship channels (e.g. RPN 9 and GMA 7 (both Manila) instead of simply Radio Philippines Network and GMA Network respectively).
