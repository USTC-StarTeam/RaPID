# Tournament format

The 2024 Championship League took place from 10 June to 3 July 2024 at the Leicester Arena in Leicester, England. The tournament was organised by Matchroom Sport and sponsored by online gambling company BetVictor. 128 players took part in the event. The competition began with 32 rounds of group matches with each group consisting of four players. Two groups were played to a finish every day using a two‑table setup in the arena. The groups were contested using a round‑robin format, with six matches played in each group. All matches in group play were played as best‑of‑four frames, with three points awarded for a win and one point for a draw. Group positions were determined by points scored, frame difference and then head‑to‑head results between players who were tied. Places that were still tied were then determined by the highest break made in the group. If the highest break was also tied, the next highest break made by the players was used. The 32 players that topped the group tables qualified for the group winners' stage, consisting of eight groups of four players. The eight winners from the group winners' stage qualified for the two final groups, with the final taking place later on the same day. The winner took the Championship League title and a place in the 2024 Champion of Champions [8].
