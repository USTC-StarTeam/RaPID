Killing_of_Brian_Thompson

Brian Thompson (July 10, 1974 – December 4, 2024), was the CEO of the American health insurance company UnitedHealthcare; who was shot and killed in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, on December 4, 2024. The shooting occurred early in the morning outside an entrance to the New York Hilton Midtown. Thompson was in the city to attend an annual investors' meeting for UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare. Prior to his death, he faced criticism for the company's rejection of insurance claims, and his family reported that he had received death threats in the past. The words "Delay", "Deny", and "Depose" were inscribed on the cartridge cases used during the shooting. The suspect, initially described as a white man wearing a mask, fled the scene. On December 9, 2024, authorities arrested 26-year-old Luigi Mangione in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and charged him in a Manhattan court with Thompson's killing.
Authorities said Mangione was carrying a 3D-printed pistol and a 3D-printed suppressor consistent with those used in the attack, as well as a short handwritten letter styled as a manifesto criticizing the American healthcare system, an American passport, and multiple fraudulent IDs, including one with the same name used to check into a hostel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Authorities also said his fingerprints matched the partial smudged prints that investigators found near the New York shooting scene. Police believe that he was inspired by Ted Kaczynski's manifesto Industrial Society and Its Future (1995), and motivated by his personal views on health insurance. They say an injury he suffered may have played a part. Mangione was arraigned in Altoona on December 9, 2024. After waiving extradition in Pennsylvania, he appeared in a federal court in New York City on December 19. On December 23, he was arraigned in the New York Supreme Court and pled not guilty to New York state charges. Mangione has been indicted on eleven state charges and faces four federal charges; the charges include first-degree murder, murder in furtherance of terrorism, criminal possession of a weapon, and stalking. He is eligible for the death penalty.
Thompson's death received widespread attention in the United States and led to polarized reactions. Many public officials expressed dismay and offered condolences to Thompson's family, though some also called attention to the health insurance industry. Opinion polls found a majority of Americans held a negative view toward the killer and the killing, with younger respondents and liberals more likely to support them. One poll found a majority of Americans felt that the practices of the health insurance industry had some responsibility for the killing. On social media, reactions to the killing largely included contempt and mockery toward Thompson and UnitedHealth Group, sympathy and praise for Mangione, and criticism of the American healthcare system and health insurance industry – primarily regarding claim denial practices. Inquiries about protective services and security for CEOs and corporate executives surged following the killing.

# Background

## Thompson and UnitedHealthcare

Brian Thompson was the chief executive officer (CEO) of UnitedHealthcare, the insurance arm of UnitedHealth Group, from April 2021 until his death. UnitedHealthcare insures 49 million Americans and generated $281 billion in revenue for the 2023 fiscal year [26] [27]. Under his leadership, UHC's profits increased from $12 billion in 2021 to $16 billion in 2023 [28]. At the time of Thompson's death, the company was the largest health insurer in the United States [29]. UnitedHealthcare has repeatedly faced criticism for its approach to handling claims. It and other insurers were named in an October 2024 report from the United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations showing a surge in prior authorization denials for Medicare Advantage patients [31]. Reports of increasing rates of prior authorization denials prompted investigations by ProPublica and the United States Senate, investigations which were described as a "stain" on Thompson's time of leadership by Fortune [28]. According to Thompson's widow, he had been receiving threats related to a "lack of  [insurance] coverage" [29]. 

## Suspected assailant's preparations

The suspect arrived in New York City on November 24, 2024, on a Greyhound bus. The bus route began in Atlanta, Georgia, but authorities do not know from which city or town he boarded. He checked into the HI New York City Hostel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on November 24, 2024, with a falsified New Jersey identification card and paid in cash [33] [34]. He stayed all but one night of the 10 days he was in New York City at the hostel, checking out on December 3, 2024 [35]. 

# Killing

Thompson was in New York City for an annual UnitedHealth Group investors' meeting, having arrived in the city on December 2, 2024. On December 4, at around 6:45 a.m [36]. EST (UTC−5), Thompson was walking along West 54th Street toward the New York Hilton Midtown hotel that was hosting the meeting. The assailant, dressed in a light-brown or cream-colored hoodie waited across the street from the hotel for several minutes, then crossed over when he saw Thompson [37]. Standing approximately 20 feet (6 m) away from Thompson when he arrived at the entrance, the assailant fired three times at him from a suppressed 9 mm pistol,    striking him in the back and right calf [38] [39] [40] [38] [39]. Three spent bullet casings were found at the scene, along with three ejected live rounds [37]. In the closed-circuit television camera (CCTV) recording of the killing, the shooter appears to manually cycle the gun action after each shot, leading observers to believe that his weapon was a malfunctioning semi-automatic pistol. The authorities believe it to be the weapon they found in the suspect's bag after his arrest—a partially 3D-printed Glock 19 and 3D-printed suppressor [42] [43]. The ghost gun consists of a 3D-printed lower receiver, metal slide, unserialized Glock 19 internals from a parts kit, including a threaded barrel, and uses a standard Glock magazine [2] [9] [44]. The 3D-printed part's design was an iteration of "FMDA 19.2", a design released in 2021 by the libertarian group Deterrence Dispensed [2] [45] [46] [47]. The killer fled the scene on an e-bike to Central Park; there, near the Carousel,  he shed a backpack containing Monopoly money and a jacket before exiting the west end of the park at 77th Street [48]. According to the police, he then left the city from the George Washington Bridge Bus Station farther uptown in Upper Manhattan [49]. Thompson was taken to Mount Sinai West hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:12 a.m [50] [51]. According to a later autopsy report, the wound to the back of the torso is what caused the death [41]. 

# Investigation

Three fired cartridge cases alongside three unfired cartridges were found at the scene. The words "delay", "deny", and "depose" were written on the cases [56]. "Depose" was inscribed on a casing from a round fired into Thompson, while "delay" was marked on an unfired cartridge ejected as the shooter appeared to be clearing a jam. The three words are similar to the phrase "delay, deny, defend", a well-known phrase in the insurance industry alluding to insurance companies' efforts to not pay out claims [42] [59]. Accordingly, police stated they were investigating whether the words suggest the killer's motive [60]. A water bottle, candy wrapper, and phone were recovered from the scene and are believed to be connected to the shooter. Police said they believed they found the shooter's backpack in Central Park on December 6, 2024 [61]. The backpack contained a Tommy Hilfiger jacket and Monopoly money [62]. The New York City Police Department offered a reward up to $10,000 for information about the shooter on December 4, 2024. The following day, authorities released images of a suspect taken by surveillance cameras at the hostel and a Starbucks café [64]. Two stills show the suspect's face including one with him smiling widely at a female desk attendant at the hostel [65]. Sources told CBS the front desk worker asked to "see his pretty smile."  The FBI joined the investigation and separately offered a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction [66] [61] [13]. The shooter was described by police as a white man, approximately 6 ft 1 in (185 cm) tall, wearing a light brown or cream-colored hooded jacket, dark pants, and black sneakers with white soles. He had a gray backpack and concealed his face with a black face mask. Police said the suspect appeared to be proficient in the use of firearms  and was described as being "extremely camera savvy" [38] [49] [68] [69] [37]. 

# Suspect

Luigi Mangione was born in Towson, Maryland,  on May 6, 1998  and belongs to a Maryland family of Italian descent [71] [72]. He attended Gilman School, an all-boys private secondary school in Baltimore, where he graduated as valedictorian in 2016 [73] [74] [6]. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League institution, graduating cum laude  and receiving a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) in computer engineering as well as a Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) in computer and information science in 2020 [75] [76]. His undergraduate studies included a minor in mathematics, and his graduate curriculum was concentrated in artificial intelligence [77]. Prior to his arrest, Mangione had no criminal record [78]. His last known residence was in Honolulu, Hawaii. In November 2024, Mangione was reported missing by his mother, who said the family had not heard from him since July of that year [80]. It was around the same time during the summer of 2024 that Mangione stopped posting on social media. Mangione's mother contacted the San Francisco Police Department, as she believed that Mangione lived in San Francisco and had a job in the area [81]. 

## Arrest and charges

Local police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, arrested Mangione on December 9, 2024, at a McDonald's restaurant in the city. An employee there called the police to say that a customer recognized the suspect from images released by the NYPD. Altoona is about 280 miles (450 km) west of New York City [83] [84]. In his bag they found a 3D-printed gun and a 3D-printed suppressor, which the police said are consistent with the weapon used in the shooting, and a falsified New Jersey driver's license with the same name as the one used by the alleged shooter to check into the Manhattan hostel [74]. The police also said that when they arrested Mangione, they found a three-page,  262-word handwritten document about the American healthcare system, which they characterized as a manifesto [8] [85] [3] [86] [86]. Mangione was charged in Blair County, Pennsylvania, with carrying a gun without a license, forgery, falsely identifying himself to the authorities, and possessing "instruments of crime" on December 9, 2024. He was arraigned at around 6 p.m [88]. at Blair County Courthouse and was denied bail. By the end of the day, he was charged in Manhattan with second-degree murder, [a] three counts of illegal weapons possession, and forgery [88] [143] [90]. He was being held in the State Correctional Institution at Huntingdon, a close-security state correctional facility in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania [91] [88] [7]. Through his Pennsylvania attorney, Mangione indicated his intention to fight a prospective interstate extradition to New York [92]. On December 13, Mangione hired Karen Friedman Agnifilo, former prosecutor at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and former legal analyst with CNN, as his New York case defense attorney. On December 17, New York prosecutors charged him with first-degree murder as murder committed in furtherance of terrorism [120]. [a]  This charge and indictment modifies with the murder charge that he was already charged with [95]. The charge of murder as an act of terrorism holds more weight than just a simple murder charge. This is due to the fact that under New York Law this kind of charge can only be levied against an individual if they “intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policies of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion and affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping.” [96] [224]. On December 19, Mangione was extradited to New York and transferred to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn following his first appearance in the Manhattan federal court. In addition to the eleven state charges, Mangione faces four new federal charges, including two counts of stalking, a new firearms-related offense, and murder through use of a modified firearm [98] [99] [100]. He is now eligible for the death penalty. On December 23, Mangione plead not guilty to all New York state charges. Agnifilo said that Mangione might not receive a fair trial due to publicity from law enforcement presentations of him, blaming Mayor of New York City Eric Adams for "unnecessary" perp walks. She added, "The mayor should know more than anyone about the presumption of innocence", and suggested Adams was trying to distract from his own case. 

## Handwritten letter

Journalist Ken Klippenstein published a 262-word handwritten note that he alleges was written by Mangione on December 10, 2024. The document directly addresses federal law enforcement, states that the killing was a lone act and that methods involved "elementary social engineering, basic CAD,  [and] a lot of patience." It references a spiral notebook containing notes and to-do lists, mentioned that " [the shooter's] tech was locked down" due to his engineering work, and apologizes for causing "strife or traumas" while insisting that "it had to be done."  According to The New York Times, the mention of CAD apparently relates to the process of 3D-printing the ghost gun's plastic frame [104] [105] [106] [107] [10]. The note characterized healthcare executives as parasites who "had it coming" and criticized the U.S. healthcare system, claiming that, despite it being the most expensive in the world, America ranked roughly 42nd in life expectancy. It specifically mentioned UnitedHealth's market capitalization, describing it as one of the largest U.S. companies, behind only Apple, Google, and Walmart. The note argues that, while many individuals had illuminated the corruption and greed within the American healthcare system decades ago, the problems have continued to persist. It goes on to say that it was "not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play," and concludes by describing the shooter as "the first to face it with such brutal honesty." [10]. The complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney's Southern District of New York calls the letter "The Feds Letter" because it is addressed "To the Feds."  The complaint was unsealed on December 19, 2024 [110]. 

## Possible motives

The current investigator theory of motive is ill will towards the health insurance industry. Police believe the motive was partially related to an injury that Mangione had suffered that caused him to visit the emergency room in July 2023 [112]. Online photos posted by Mangione showed screws in his back, though the identity of the person pictured is unverified. Mangione allegedly had spondylolisthesis, a lower back condition [14] [112]. Sources told CBS they believed Mangione had resentment towards UnitedHealthcare as well as other health insurance companies [113]. According to UnitedHealthcare, he was not one of their customers [13]. New York Police Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny believes Mangione may have targeted them because of the company's size [114]. Police believe that Mangione was inspired, in part, by Ted Kaczynski's Industrial Society and Its Future. Mangione's account posted a Goodreads review of Industrial Society and Its Future,  describing Kaczynski as "rightfully imprisoned" and was critical of his use of violence against innocent individuals [12] [115]. The review, which gave the manifesto four out of five stars, also contained a quote that the reviewer claimed to have found online. The quote contained the lines "'Violence never solved anything' is a statement uttered by cowards and predators" and "when all other forms of communication fail, violence is necessary to survive." [116] [117] [118]. A report on the killing by the New York City Police Department's Intelligence & Counterterrorism Bureau  was obtained by independent journalist Dan Boguslaw, and published in full by Klippenstein on December 26 [119]. The intelligence report focused on Mangione's motive and people who express sympathy for him, whom the bureau labeled as "extremists". The report assessed that Mangione was motivated by "what he perceives as a 'parasitic' health insurance company and industry as a whole, as well as broader objections to corporate greed and a concern for modern society". 

# Reactions

## Public and online

Shortly after the event, two of the houses owned by Thompson's family were swatted. Stocks for UnitedHealth fell the week of the shooting and fell a further 5.6% on December 11, 2024 [121]. As of December 17, 2024, UnitedHealth Group lost more than $110 billion in market value since the killing, with similar groups experiencing losses [122] [123]. Steve Kopack, writing for NBC News, noted that "the downturns largely reflect investors' reactions to public outrage at the health care system in the wake of the killing". Many social media users expressed their contempt for Thompson, UnitedHealthcare, and the nation's health insurance system while expressing sympathy for and praising the assailant for his actions. Social media users shared stories of health insurance claim denials online,    and joked about the killing with memes and gallows humor [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] [131]. NBC News reported that the "main theme animating many of the posts about the Thompson killing was that UnitedHealthcare and other insurance companies harm and kill Americans by denying coverage in the name of profit" [132]. One physician told The Daily Beast that they believed the perpetrator should be brought to justice, but they also stated that Thompson's role as CEO had led to a great amount of suffering and loss of life, which he described as "on the order of millions", adding that " [it is] hard for me to sympathize when so many people have suffered because of his company" [133]. Internet culture journalist Taylor Lorenz analyzed the responses on social media and wrote on her blog: "No, that does not mean people should murder them [134]. But if you've watched a loved one suffer and die from insurance denial, it's normal to wish the people responsible would suffer the same fate." [135]. The shooter has been called a folk hero and celebrated as a vigilante by some of the general public. He has been compared to Robin Hood  and the Dillinger Gang [136]. The case has also been compared to Joker and V for Vendetta, alluding to "ordinary citizens battling huge systems" [137]. Mangione has also been noted for his perceived physical attractiveness [138]. The McDonald's where Mangione was arrested was review bombed as a result of a tip from a customer who alerted an employee after recognizing the suspect [139] [140]. There have been protests in support of Mangione outside courts where he appeared [141] [142] [143] [144]. At a protest near the Manhattan courthouse, masked women sang "The Hanging Tree", a song popularized in The Hunger Games [145] [146]. "Wanted posters" of CEOs appeared in Manhattan [147]. Street art, graffiti, and signs in support of Mangione appeared on buildings, streets, highways, and other places [148]. A billboard with the words "Free Luigi" was seen in Riverside County, California [149] [150] [151]. After Thompson's death, UnitedHealthcare's parent company, UnitedHealth Group, published a statement on Facebook detailing the death and their official condolences. Though the post's comment section was deactivated, over 100,000 Facebook users responded to the post with a "Haha" (or "laughing") reaction. Items and merchandise in support of Mangione were posted on Etsy, Amazon and other e-commerce sites before being removed [153] [133] [154]. According to the Network Contagion Research Institute, since Mangione's arrest, variations of "#FreeLuigi" have been shared over 50,000 times on X [155] [156] [157]. They also found that "by some measures", engagement with posts about Thompson's killing on platforms such as X and Reddit "surpassed that of the assassination attempt against Donald Trump in July."  The NCRI also found that out of the top ten most-engaged tweets that mention Thompson or UnitedHealth, six of the posts implicitly or explicitly supported the killing or criticized Thompson [158]. Some highlighted comments called for class war. Crowdsourcing fundraisers were also started by supporters of Mangione to cover his legal costs on GoFundMe, before being removed. A GiveSendGo fundraiser has remained live;  as of December 24, it has raised over $200,000 [160] [161]. Other social media users linked Mangione's jail commissary account soliciting donations for "snacks, sodas, an iPad, etc."  Thomas Dickey, Mangione's defense attorney, commented on the crowdfunding campaign by saying: "The Supreme Court says all these rich billionaires can give all kind of money to candidates and that's 'free speech,' so maybe these people were exercising their right to free speech and saying that's the way they're supporting my client." [162] [163] [164]. 

## Health insurance corporations

UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty defended the company's claim denial practices in an internal video which was leaked after the fatal shooting of Thompson. Recorded on December 5, the day after Thompson's death, Witty emphasized the company's role in ensuring "safe and appropriate" care and that the insurance giant will continue to prevent "unnecessary care". Some online comments made death threats in response [165]. One former health insurance executive was quoted by the Financial Times as saying that threats against health insurance companies are common, and that "We'd have times when you'd deny proton laser therapy for a kid with seizures and the parent would freak out." Another executive was quoted as saying, "What's most disturbing is the ability of people to hide behind their keyboards and lose their humanity." [167] [133]. UnitedHealthcare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and CVS Health, which operates Aetna, all removed photographs and other information about their executive leadership from their websites following Thompson's killing. Managed care provider Centene cancelled their in-person investor's day which had been scheduled for December 12, and instead planned a virtual conference [168] [169]. Additionally, the days following Thompson's death saw a surge in inquiries about protective services and security for CEOs and corporate executives, according to private security firm Allied Universal [170]. Michael Sherman, the former chief medical officer at Point32Health, justified the concerns of health insurance executives, saying, "It doesn't seem paranoid to worry that someone who's had services denied that they may believe are important might be in an emotionally unstable state."  Private security intelligence firm DragonFly assessed that further attacks on business leaders were unlikely, and that political groups that celebrate the murder "will almost certainly use non-violent – but still threatening – tactics" like "staging protests outside corporate offices, verbally confronting executives and swatting them." [171] [132] [172]. 

## Politicians

In response to the killing, public officials including Minnesota governor Tim Walz and Senator Amy Klobuchar expressed dismay and offered condolences to the family. Walz said that he knew Thompson. Democratic House representative Dean Phillips wrote that he was "horrified by the assassination."  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro commented that "Some attention in this case, especially online, has been deeply disturbing, as some have looked to celebrate instead of condemning this killer."  Maryland state delegate Nino Mangione, cousin of Luigi Mangione said, "Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi's arrest [173] [174] [175]. We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson, and we ask people to pray for all involved". White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the government condemned the incident and said that "violence to combat any sort of corporate greed is unacceptable". Department of Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said that social media rhetoric about the killing was alarming, and that "It speaks of what is really bubbling here in this country, and unfortunately we see that manifested in violence, the domestic violent extremism that exists" [177]. President-elect Donald Trump also condemned the killing and called celebration of Mangione "a sickness" [178] [179]. Commenting on Thompson's killing in an interview on ABC's This Week, Democratic House representative Ro Khanna said, "There is no justification for violence". He added that the public reaction to Thompson's killing did not surprise him because "We waste hundreds of billions a year on health care administrative expenses that make insurance CEOs and wealthy stockholders incredibly rich while 85 million Americans go uninsured or underinsured". Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said: "The visceral response from people across this country who feel cheated, ripped off, and threatened by the vile practices of their insurance companies should be a warning to everyone in the health care system [181]. Violence is never the answer, but people can be pushed only so far."  Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said: "This is not to say that an act of violence is justified, but I think for anyone who is confused or shocked or appalled, they need to understand that people interpret and feel and experience denied claims as an act of violence against them." [182] [183]. In an interview with socialist magazine Jacobin, Senator Bernie Sanders condemned the killing, but said the public response showed that many people were angry at health insurance companies and their practices. He later defended Warren's comments, saying she didn't applaud the killing, but noted people's response and the conditions of Americans and the working class [184]. Senator Ron Wyden commented that "I've long said violence, murder, are always unacceptable, always [185] [186]. But I think that there is a context, you know, here that is hugely important". Senator Raphael Warnock said the incident was a "flash point", but didn't know if it would spark conversations on healthcare reform [187]. 

## Academic commentators

Zeynep Tufekci, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton University and New York Times columnist, said that the public reaction to the fatal shooting of Thompson resembled the reaction to the very high levels of corporate greed, exploitation, and economic inequality during the American Gilded Age, a period characterized by violent "political movements that targeted corporate titans, politicians, judges and others". Tufekci further wrote: "The concentration of extreme wealth in the United States has recently surpassed that of the Gilded Age [188]. And the will among politicians to push for broad public solutions appears to have all but vanished. I fear that instead of an era of reform, the response to this act of violence and to the widespread rage it has ushered into view will be limited to another round of retreat by the wealthiest." [188]. Robert Pape, an expert in political violence at the University of Chicago, told The Guardian that the response of online commentators was indicative of Americans' growing acceptance of violence to settle civil disputes. 

## Opinion polling

An Emerson College poll surveyed 1,000 American registered voters between December 11 and 13 and found that a majority (68%) of voters view the actions of the suspected killer as unacceptable. Among young voters aged 18–29, 41% found the killing "acceptable or somewhat acceptable", while 40% in the same age group did not, making it the only age group where those who found the actions acceptable outnumbered those who did not. NORC at the University of Chicago conducted a poll of 1,001 American adults between December 12 to 16. A majority of respondents said they had read or heard about Thompson's death. When asked about the factors contributing to Thompson's death, 78 percent of respondents said the killer had either a "great deal" (63%) or a "moderate amount" (15%) of responsibility, while 20% said the killer had "only a little" (9%) or "none at all" (11%). 69% of respondents said denials for health care coverage by health insurance companies had either a "great deal" (44%) or a "moderate amount" (24%) of responsibility, while 67% said profits made by health insurance companies had either a "great deal" (43%) or a "moderate amount" (25%) of responsibility. 53 percent of respondents also said wealth or income inequality in general had at least a moderate amount of responsibility. Young Americans were the least likely age group to say that the killer is responsible, with only 4 in 10 respondents in the 18-29 age group saying so, compared to 8 in 10 respondents over 60. Young Americans were also "especially likely" to say that Thompson's death was a result of multiple factors, including coverage denials and profits by health insurance companies. An Economist/YouGov poll conducted from December 15 to 17 surveying 1,553 U.S. adult citizens found that 43% of American citizens had a "somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable" view of Mangione, while 21% had a "somewhat favorable or very favorable view of him." 37% were unsure. Mangione received the most support from citizens aged 18–29, who viewed him favorably by a 39%–29% margin, and "very liberal" citizens, who viewed him favorably by a 47%–31% margin. Mangione was viewed least favorably by citizens aged 65 and older (65%–5% unfavorable) and "very conservative" citizens (62%–8% unfavorable). A December 12, 2024, online poll of 1,000 registered voters in the US taken by conservative Republican pollster Scott Rasmussen/RMG Research, Inc. found that 53% of respondents view the killer as a "villain", while 10% view the killer as a "hero", 22% said neither label applies, and 15% said they were unsure. 71% of voters said murder is "never justifiable", while 13% said it is justifiable to murder someone like Thompson as a means to bring about important societal change; 16% were unsure. The poll found that younger voters, Progressive Democrats, "people who talk politics every day", and those with a postgraduate degree were "more likely than others to say that such murder is sometimes justifiable". The Center for Strategic Politics ran an online poll with 455 American adults on December 11 and found that "61% of respondents said they have a strong or somewhat negative perception of Mangione", 19% had a positive or somewhat positive view, and 21% did not know. Opinions on Mangione vary "dramatically" by age, with respondents under 45 holding a more positive view of him than those over 45. Additionally, they indicated that men were more likely to support Mangione than women, and Black and Hispanic respondents were more likely to support him than White respondents. The poll also found that young Americans view Mangione "far more favorably" than they viewed Thompson and UnitedHealthcare [192]. A poll of 6,000 U.S. adults was conducted by CloudResearch on December 19, utilizing AI. The poll found that 27% of respondents were sympathetic to Mangione, with 12% supporting the murder. Support for the murder was higher among those under 30 and the political left. Among those who supported it, AI analysis showed that 80% did so because of "systemic injustices" and 30% because they related to his situation. Generation Lab conducted a poll of 1,026 U.S. college students between December 19 and 23. When asked about who they sympathized with more, 45% of respondents said the suspect, 17% said Thompson, and 37% said neither. Half of respondents view the suspect extremely or somewhat favorably, and nearly half (48%) of respondents believed the killing was justified. 81% of respondents said they have an extremely or somewhat negative view of Thompson. Axios noted that "among young people, there's lasting support for and fascination with  [the] suspected killer — and disdain for the victim". USA Today/Suffolk University conducted a poll of over 1,000 registered voters between January 7 and 11. The poll found that almost two-thirds of respondents thought the killing was wrong and that the killer should be prosecuted. Most of the rest agreed it was wrong, but that they understood the killer's anger. 

## Other

Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein, who obtained and published the full text of Mangione's alleged manifesto on his Substack, stated that numerous major media outlets refused to publish the manifesto despite being in possession of it, criticizing them for instead quoting it "selectively". In an interview with Democracy Now!, Klippenstein blamed paternalistic attitudes in corporate media and the possibility of alienating law enforcement sources for the reluctance to publish the alleged manifesto's full text [107] [198] [105] [106]. Klippenstein also said he spoke to rank and file healthcare workers who expressed sympathy with the anger the public expressed at the health insurance industry, and criticized The New York Times and Washington Post for publishing stories that claimed that healthcare workers felt alienated by the public's response. Klippenstein also alleged that The New York Times directed their staff to "dial back" on showing photographs containing Mangione's face [199] [200]. [undue weight? – discuss] [201] [202] [203]. On December 27, the Southern Nevada Counter Terrorism Center released an internal security advisory, which was published on January 19 by Property of the People. The report assessed that "violent rhetoric and threats to healthcare and other corporate executives will increase" due to the shooting and recommended multiple personal security practices for "high-profile government and private sector individuals". Engadget reported that moderators of subreddits on Reddit were instructed to remove posts and links containing Mangione's alleged manifesto. A Reddit spokesperson said that posting the alleged manifesto violated the company's rules, which prohibit content that "encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm". A week after the shooting, a woman in Florida was arrested and charged with "threats to conduct a mass shooting or act of terrorism" after allegedly saying "Delay, deny, depose, you people are next" to representatives of Blue Cross Blue Shield after her claim was denied. The judge set her bail at $100,000, citing "the status of our country at this point" [206] [207] [208]. 

# In the media

## Comedy

The killing of Thompson was referenced in various season 50 skits of American sketch comedy late-night television Saturday Night Live (SNL). Anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che joked about the killing during the Weekend Update, saying "It really says something about America that a guy was murdered in cold blood and the two main reactions were 'Yeah, well healthcare stinks' and also 'Girl, that shooter hot'". Comedian Chris Rock also joked about the killing, saying in his opening monologue: "Everybody's fixated on how good-looking  [Mangione] looks [210] [211]. If he looked like Jonah Hill, no one would care," and "I have condolences for the health care CEO. I mean, this is a real person. But, you know, sometimes drug dealers get shot". The jokes were criticized by some viewers. On December 21, Saturday Night Live Weekend Update host Colin Jost mentioned Mangione during a joke, which was met with "rapturous applause" from the audience. Jost responded by saying "Yeah... definitely woo" and "You're wooing for justice, right?". The applause and Jost's response were criticized by Piers Morgan, Jennifer Sey, and Stephen Miller [215]. In a Netflix roasting special, comedian Tim Dillon portrayed Thompson's ghost, stating: "I'm going to hell for this... you might as well laugh." Dillon was wrapped in chains and tossed pill bottles into the audience, stating that it was fentanyl. He joked: "Let me tell you, your reaction to my murder makes me sick... and not the type of sick I would immediately deny for not having the proper paperwork. You've gotta have the paperwork." [217]. 

## Documentaries

Vulture reported that there are currently four documentaries about the killing of Thompson, one of which has already aired, and three are still in the works. One documentary is being developed by Alex Gibney and Anonymous Content,  and another by Stephen Robert Morse [218] [219]. On December 17, Discovery announced that they planned to air their own documentary, whose working title is reported to be Who is Luigi Mangione? [220]. ABC's documentary Manhunt: Luigi Mangione and the CEO Murder — A Special Edition of 20/20 aired on December 19, 2024 [218]. On January 2, 2025, Tubi released the New York Post documentary New York Post Presents: Luigi Mangione Monster or Martyr?;  while Fox is scheduled to premiere TMZ Investigates: Luigi Mangione: The Mind of a Killer January 6, 2025 [218] [221].
