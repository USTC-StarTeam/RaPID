By a stroke of luck, he meets Shyam Mahato, another refugee who is a laborer in the coal mines of the Damodar Valley. Mohan also joins him as a worker and they develop a strong bond of friendship over the time [30]. While suffering the humiliation of working life, they decide to wield complete dominance over the mine. By stealing coal, whether from wagons or from the lifted parts or through various secret methods, they go to Billu Paswan, the only coal merchant in the area, hoping to sell at a high price; but Billu insults them by calling ordinary laborers with lofty dreams and pays them a meager wage, while Shyam manages to grab their fair values by beating him up. Together with Shyam's strength and Mohan's mastermind, they move up the ranks gaining monopoly control over the entire colliery. They successfully develop their complete influence over the coal syndicate, being the first coal mafia duo in the Khadaan. Declared a restricted zone, it gets named after Shyam and Mohan. [31]. Having already escaped deadly conspiracies multiple times, the excavation of the coal mine begins under their leadership. But when digging starts in the cultivated lands, Balai Mandi, the local tribal leader, interrupt them. Shyam and Mohan promise them that no agricultural lands will be grabbed for the excavation and also give them 20 percent share of the mines. They declare the mines to be entrusted to the tribals over the first two hours of a day and even bring Mandi into their fold. If a worker dies suddenly while working in mines, a law was made to wrap his body in a sack and throw in the river. In the mean time, they become the messiahs for the poor labourers and the adivasi community. This amplification in power helps them to start circulating in the political arena, buying them in a stand against Shehzada Siddiqui, the local MLA. They succeed to win Siddiqui's heart by saving him from a surprise attack by his opposition Kashinath Mahali. In an heated confrontation and argument, Shyam killed a police officer. This resulted in him going behind the bars, at a time when he had a newborn child and wife Jamuna. But he mysteriously dies inside the jail. 2024: Now, Mohan has become a rich industrialist in that region through the illegal coal syndicate and has also gained monopoly over the mines. He gently offers Shyam's son Madhu to join his lead team, who is just a coal transporter now. This does not go well with Makhan, Mohan's son who had hoped to inherit his father's business.

## Critical reception

Subhasmita Kanji of Hindustan Times rated the film 4.3 out 5 stars and opined "Khadaan is a paisa-vasool masala entertainer. Every frame speaks of the huge production value of the film, in which Dev's character aroused back the memories and nostalgia of his initial films." She praised Idhika's vibrant acting, Anirban's character, Rathijit and Nilayan's music and the storytelling but criticised the script for being predictable at certain points. Sandipta Bhanja of Sangbad Pratidin reviewed the film on a positive note and wrote "Dev is the heartstring of the film [213]. His ostracized action hero avatar is a visual treat while his romantic avatar triggers back the nostalgia of his initial days." She praised Jisshu and Idhika's acting, John's debut performance, Anirban's tribal accent and Dev's comeback to commercial genre after a decade but criticized the twists for being somewhat predictable. Addressing Dev as the "Dynamo" of the film, the IWM Buzz critic Shatakshi Ganguly opined "There’s a certain electricity in the air when a film as ambitious as Khadaan makes its way to the screen. From its first explosive frames, the film establishes itself as a film with grand ambitions. As Shyam Mahato, Dev is at once fiery and grounded, oscillating between moments of sheer rage and heartfelt vulnerability. Quiet, composed, and deeply empathetic, Jisshu’s presence as Mohan serves as the moral compass of the story."  Anurupa Chakraborty of the Indian Express rated the film 3.5/5 stars and highlighted "Khadaan is a commercial entertainer with high octane action, romance and songs [214]. The chemistry between Dev and Jisshu drives the film." She speacially praised Jisshu's performance in the film, the BGM, John's short cameo and Dev's comeback in mass avatar after many years but mentioned that the story could have been written better. Sangita Chowdhury of Aajkal Bangla rated the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and quoted "Apart from the performances by the whole cast, Shailesh Awashthi's cinematography is the main highlight of the film, which takes the viewers to a new world."  Agnivo Niyogi of The Telegraph reviewed the film and noted "The synergy between Shyam and Mohan anchors the film and helps this otherwise straightforward story sail through." He criticised weakly written characters for Idhika and Barkha but specially praised the soundtrack and picturisation on the Kirtan track "Radharani" [216]. Poorna Banerjee of The Times of India rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and quoted "Khadaan thrives on Dev’s commanding presence and a lot of action sequences that are well shot. For fans of action dramas and larger-than-life protagonists, this might just hit the mark." She praised the cinematography, editing, music and high octane action sequences but mentioned Idhika's role to be unimpressive. A reviewer from ETV Bharat noted "Khadaan is a full masala entertainer that brought Dev back to his old avatar, characterised by heavy action scenes and romantic sequences." Although Jisshu's seasoned acting, Anirban' character, John's debut, Idhika's performance and chemistry with Dev was praised, it was stated that the screenplay could have been better [218]. 

# Future

The ending of the film hints towards a sequel. But, in an interview, Dev mentioned that Khadaan 2 will be made depending upon the reception of Khadaan and only if the maiden part becomes commercially successful [220].
