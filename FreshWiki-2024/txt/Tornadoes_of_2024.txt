Tornadoes_of_2024

This page documents notable tornadoes and tornado outbreaks worldwide in 2024. Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Argentina, Southern Brazil, the Bengal region and China, but can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during summer in the Northern Hemisphere and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe, South Africa, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Tornadic events are often accompanied by other forms of severe weather, including thunderstorms, strong winds and hail.
Worldwide, 90 tornado-related deaths were confirmed – 53 in the United States, 14 in China, 12 in South Africa, 5 in India, 3 in Indonesia, 2 in Mexico and 1 in Russia.

# Events

## United States

In the United States, the year started off somewhat slow with a below average number of tornadoes through the first three months. However, the El Niño pattern that was in place during that period weakened in April; the pattern shift caused the more traditional Tornado Alley zone to rapidly become extremely favorable for tornado outbreaks, and several large outbreaks occurred in late spring. In a month-long span between April 26 and May 26, almost 700 tornadoes touched down across the United States, causing widespread destruction and dozens of casualties. Average to above average activity continued through essentially the rest of the year as several derechos and multiple outbreaks spawned by tropical cyclones occurred across the United States. As a result, 2024 ended as the second most active year on record for tornadoes, with 1,880 preliminary reports and at least 1,777 confirmed tornadoes. Only 2004 had more tornadoes with 1,817. This year surpassed 2019 as the busiest year ever recorded in Oklahoma, with at least 152 confirmed tornadoes. 2024 was also the busiest year on record for tornadoes in Florida, Illinois, Iowa, New York, Ohio and West Virginia [2].

## Europe

According to the European Severe Storms Laboratory, there were 1,035 confirmed reports of tornadoes and waterspouts in Europe in 2024, resulting in one fatality and 25+ injuries. 

# January

## January 3 (Belgium)

A tornado struck the communities of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-Waver and Putte in Belgium. Multiple houses had roofing material torn off, one of which sustained collapse of a gable. Garages, outbuildings, and greenhouses were destroyed and gravestones were damaged at a cemetery. Trees and fences were toppled over as well. One person and several horses were injured. The European Severe Storms Laboratory rated the tornado IF1.5. 

## January 8–10 (United States)

During the evening of January 8 through January 9, a severe weather outbreak brought damaging winds and numerous tornadoes to the Southeastern and Eastern United States. On January 7, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk for severe weather in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, including a 10% hatched risk for tornadoes. The outbreak began with several brief EF0 tornadoes touching down in Louisiana and Mississippi on January 8. Later that night, multiple tornadic supercell thunderstorms formed over the Gulf of Mexico and began moving toward the Gulf Coast and Florida Panhandle. In the early morning hours of January 9, a powerful tornadic waterspout formed offshore of Panama City Beach, Florida and moved inland at EF3 intensity, causing major damage in the Lower Grand Lagoon community. Multiple homes, condominiums, apartment buildings, and businesses were severely damaged or destroyed and large boat storage warehouses sustained significant damage at the Pirate's Cove Marina. The tornado continued to cause lesser damage in the western part of Panama City before it dissipated. A high-end EF2 tornado also touched down in Lynn Haven, causing significant damage along the shores of Deer Point Lake to dozens of mobile and frame homes. A brief but strong EF2 tornado significantly damaged a few houses in Callaway and an EF1 tornado caused moderate damage in Santa Rosa Beach as well. Another strong EF2 tornado impacted the outskirts of Marianna, where many RVs were thrown and destroyed at an RV park and dozens of frame homes were badly damaged or destroyed in subdivisions. The longest-tracked and widest tornado of the outbreak touched down southwest of Graceville before it crossed into Alabama and struck Cottonwood at EF2 strength, unroofing homes, collapsing the walls of a brick business, and completely destroying a Moose Lodge building. One person was killed northeast of Cottonwood when the tornado obliterated a mobile home. Several more EF1 tornadoes also touched down in Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, including a tornado that struck the eastern edge of Claremont, North Carolina and rolled a manufactured home, resulting in another fatality. The final significant tornado of the day was an EF2 tornado that struck Bamberg, South Carolina, where multiple historic brick buildings were destroyed, and a barrel factory suffered major damage. In all, 38 tornadoes were confirmed, resulting in two fatalities. Four additional fatalities unrelated to tornadoes occurred during the event as well. The system responsible for this tornado outbreak also produced heavy snow and blizzard conditions in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Midwest, and the Northeastern United States [6]. 

## January 18 (Indonesia)

A damaging tornado struck the villages of Walidono and Cangkring in East Java, damaging 253 homes and 10 public buildings. Nineteen people were injured, two of them seriously. 

# February

## February 4 (Indonesia)

A tornado damaged or destroyed at least 300 homes and numerous other buildings as it moved through the villages of Kedung Wonokerto, Bendo Tretek, and Watutulis within the Prambon District in East Java. Sheet metal debris was scattered throughout the damage path and trees were downed. A man was killed by flying debris when the shop he was in was destroyed by the tornado, and at least one other person was injured. 

## February 4 (United States)

Several tornadoes touched down in Georgia and Florida on February 4, including an EF1 tornado that caused damage at the historic Seminole Plantation near Boston, Georgia. Cottages sustained roof, chimney, and structural damage and some open-air barns on the property were also damaged. Dozens of trees were downed as well, one of which landed on a building. The strongest tornado of the day produced EF2 damage near Valdosta, destroying two manufactured homes and injuring two people. An outbuilding was also destroyed, a metal building was severely damaged, and several other homes sustained less intense damage elsewhere along the path. A few weak tornadoes caused minor damage in Florida, including an EF0 tornado that touched down in the western outskirts of Jacksonville, damaging trees and fences and overturning a dumpster. A total of six tornadoes were confirmed. 

## February 8 (United States)

A localized severe weather weather event in Illinois and Wisconsin produced multiple supercells. One supercell produced the first recorded February tornado in Wisconsin near Juda, which heavily damaged a frail prefabricated house at high-end EF1 intensity, caused more minor damage to two other homes, destroyed outbuildings, and rolled several campers. The same supercell spawned a strong, long-tracked EF2 tornado that touched down near Evansville, Wisconsin and moved through the rural community of Porter, causing significant damage to numerous farmsteads. Multiple houses were heavily damaged and had large portions of their roofs torn off, and many barns, sheds, and metal farm buildings were completely destroyed with debris scattered long distances across fields. Farming equipment was tossed around, trees and power poles were snapped, and one person was injured when the tornado blew their car off a road into a ditch. Less severe damage occurred in and around Albion and Busseyville before the tornado dissipated. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published the tornado caused more than $2.5 million in damage [12]. An EF1 tornado that destroyed farm buildings, damaged a metal garage, and overturned a semi-truck near McNabb, Illinois was also confirmed [13]. 

## February 14 (Cyprus and Turkey)

An IF1.5 tornado struck populated areas in Germasogeia, Limassol, Cyprus on the night of February 14. Roughly 200 homes and apartment buildings sustained roof damage, some of which had a considerable amount of their roof tiles removed. Trees, signs, and fences were downed, and a crane at a construction site collapsed. Dozens of cars were damaged by flying debris as well. One person was injured and multiple families were displaced from their homes. Additionally, an IF0.5 tornado touched down in Tece, Mersin Province, Turkey, damaging trees. 

## February 21 (Indonesia)

A tornado caused significant damage and was caught on video from multiple angles as it struck Rancaekek  [id], Bandung Regency and parts of Sumedang Regency. It injured 22 people and damaged or destroyed more than 500 structures. Large trucks were overturned and trees were blown over as well. The tornado was given a rating of F2 on the Fujita scale, making it the strongest rated tornado to strike Indonesia [14]. 

## February 22 (Brazil)

A rare northern Brazil tornado hit Estrela de Alagoas, Alagoas. According to MetSul Meteorologia, the damage caused by the tornado was rated F1. 

## February 27–28 (United States)

A severe weather outbreak produced numerous tornadoes across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley regions in late February. The Storm Prediction Center outlined two separate enhanced risk areas on February 27; one in northern Illinois, and the other along the Ohio River [23] [19]. Severe storms developed later that evening and moved through the Chicago metropolitan area, producing straight-line wind damage and multiple EF0 and EF1 tornadoes throughout the region, including three parallel tornadoes that moved in tandem through the towns of Inverness, Hoffman Estates, Palatine, and South Barrington. Both O'Hare and Midway International Airports issued ground stops as the system moved through the area, and travelers were encouraged to seek shelter in interior locations and in underground tunnels [6] [23] [20] [21]. In Michigan, a low-end EF2 tornado struck Grand Blanc, where warehouses were significantly damaged at an industrial park, trees and power poles were snapped, and gas leaks were reported [22] [23]. The storms moved into Ohio during the early morning hours of February 28, producing several tornadoes in and around the Dayton and Columbus metro areas [28] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29]. An EF1 tornado moved through the Dayton suburbs of Riverside and Fairborn, damaging airplanes and a hangar at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, before damaging apartment buildings and trees near Wright State University [30] [31] [6] [32]. A high-end EF2 tornado severely damaged or destroyed multiple homes and unroofed a church as it passed near Springfield, then destroyed a hangar and tossed small planes at the Madison County Airport near London. In southeastern Ohio, two EF2 tornadoes damaged multiple houses and destroyed outbuildings near Gahanna and Miltonsburg. Overall, a total of 24 tornadoes were confirmed as a result of this outbreak, which resulted in three injuries. 

# March

## March 2 (India and Pakistan)

A tornado touched down near Moga, Punjab, causing significant damage. Shortly after the Moga tornado, another tornado touched down and caused damage in Jhelum, Punjab, Pakistan [33] [34]. 

## March 5 (Turkey and France)

Several tornadoes and waterspouts touched down in Europe. One waterspout hit Demre, Turkey, causing IF1 damage to 175 decares of greenhouses and electricity poles [184]. A second IF1 tornado affected Göksu, Hacıveliler, Yenimahalle, Kumluca and Toptaş in  Antalya Province, along a 12 km long and 80 meter wide path [39]. Weak greenhouses were damaged, a mobile construction trailer was shifted, roofs were damaged and trees were downed. Six people sustained injuries. Another IF1 tornado hit Payallar, causing near complete destruction of a weak greenhouse facility, and tossing a container into the greenhouse facility, causing one injury [40] [41]. A total of three people were injured. Two unrated tornadoes touched down in France [42]. 

## March 9 (Spain)

An IF2 rated tornado struck the town of Córdoba during the early hours of the night. Wind speeds are calculated to be around 200 km/h and several structures sustained light to severe damage. No fatalities or injuries were reported. Another IF1.5 struck the thermosolar plant in the nearby town of Posadas. 

## March 9 (United States)

A small severe weather event impacted the states of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, producing multiple tornadoes. In the early morning hours, a high-end EF1 tornado touched down east of Ozark, Alabama, causing tree damage and impacting several homes and outbuildings. Later that morning, another EF1 tornado occurred north of Miccosukee, Florida, resulting in tree damage only. Another tornado formed northeast of Argyle, Georgia, damaging two structures and numerous trees and receiving a rating of EF1 [48]. During the early afternoon, a significant tornado touched down southeast of Nahunta, Georgia [49]. This tornado caused significant damage, including the roof of a home being severely damaged and the destruction of a travel trailer. Additionally, a double-wide manufactured home was completely destroyed, with its undercarriage thrown into trees and bent. Five people sustained injuries, and the tornado received a high-end EF2 rating, with wind speeds up to 130 mph (210 km/h). In total, four tornadoes were confirmed during this event. 

## March 13–15 (United States)

From the evening of March 13 through March 15, a severe weather and tornado outbreak impacted the Central, Midwestern, and Southern United States. On March 13, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk for severe weather across Kansas and Missouri. Two tornadoes touched down that day in Kansas, near Alta Vista and Rossville, both of which caused EF2 damage. On March 14, the Storm Prediction Center issued another enhanced risk area for parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Missouri, including a 10% risk area for tornadoes [50]. However, the most intense supercells formed northeast of that area in the Ohio Valley. That afternoon, a low-end EF2 tornado touched down in Hanover, Indiana, tearing the roofs off a few homes, before crossing into Kentucky and striking the town of Milton, destroying numerous trailers and causing damage to many homes [51]. The tornado then re-entered Indiana and destroyed more trailers near Brooksburg before lifting. Two people were injured by this tornado. That evening, a long-tracked supercell produced numerous tornadoes in Indiana and Ohio [6] [52]. The first tornado spawned by this supercell was a brief EF1 tornado near Celina,   before another EF1 tornado directly struck Celina and the nearby community of St Marys [53] [54]. The supercell then spawned a multiple-vortex, high-end EF3 tornado that impacted the towns of Wapakoneta and Lakeview, destroying manufactured homes, uprooting and partially debarking trees, and obliterating RVs at a trailer park where a site-built structure was also destroyed [55]. Three people were killed, and 26 others were injured by this tornado. Shortly thereafter, a separate supercell to the north of the Lakeview supercell produced an EF2 tornado that completely destroyed a manufactured home and damaged trees, homes, and outbuildings near Plymouth [56]. After the Lakeview EF3 tornado dissipated, the storm produced an EF2 tornado that caused major damage to homes, outbuildings, and trees as it passed near Raymond, through Broadway, and near Ostrander [57]. The final tornado from the Lakeview supercell was a long-tracked EF1 tornado that passed near Delaware, Sunbury, Galena, and St [58]. Louisville. Just south of the Lakeview supercell, another supercell spawned an EF2 tornado that impacted Selma, Indiana [59]. Later, the storm spawned another strong tornado near Farmland, Indiana, which tore the roofs off numerous homes as it moved eastward [60] [61]. The tornado then struck Winchester at high-end EF3 intensity, destroying many homes, a church, and a Taco Bell restaurant. The tornado then crossed the border into Ohio, causing EF1-EF2 damage to farmsteads as it moved through Darke and Miami counties before dissipating near Bradford. The tornado injured 40 people with one person dying from their injuries about a month later. Further south, a low-end EF2 tornado destroyed a metal structure and snapped many trees in Hot Springs Village, Arkansas as well [6] [60] [62] [63]. Only isolated, weak tornadic activity occurred on March 15 before the outbreak came to an end [64]. In total, 34 tornadoes were confirmed from this outbreak along with four fatalities and 69 injuries [65]. 

## March 27 (Italy and France)

A weak unrated tornado occurred just north-east of downtown Verona, Italy within the north-eastern suburb of Borgo Venezia  [it]. Another IF2 tornado hit Port-Joinville  [fr], France, damaging 60 roofs and downing trees. One person sustained injuries. 

## March 31 (India)

A tornado, accompanied by a nor'wester, struck the city of Jalpaiguri, West Bengal, killing five people and injuring over 100 others. More than 100 houses were destroyed by the tornado. 

## March 31 (China)

An EF2 tornado was confirmed from an overnight extreme QLCS event in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province. The tornado sucked three people out of high-rise buildings and caused four fatalities in total. 

# April

## April 1–3 (United States)

From April 1 through April 3, a derecho   and significant tornado outbreak occurred primarily in the Central Plains, Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic [72] [73]. On April 1, a moderate risk for severe weather was issued across parts of Oklahoma and Texas, including a 10% hatched area for tornadoes. On April 1, several weak tornadoes occurred across Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Missouri, including an EF0 tornado that overturned a tractor trailer near Lenapah. Two non-tornadic injuries were reported due to high winds toppling trees in Kentucky and Indiana. Tornadic activity continued into the early morning hours of April 2 across the Ohio River Valley. An EF2 tornado touched down near Lake of Egypt, Illinois, downing numerous trees, power lines, and causing damage to a few outbuildings. Another EF2 tornado damaged a metal building and rolled a mobile home near Eldorado, injuring two people. An EF2 tornado caused considerable damage to several buildings near Uniontown in Kentucky. EF2 tornadoes also impacted the towns of New Harmony and Cynthiana in Indiana. On the afternoon of April 2, an EF2 tornado downed numerous trees and damaged the roof of a home in Cannonsburg, Kentucky. Hundreds of hardwood trees were downed by an EF2 tornado near Fayetteville, West Virginia. Another EF2 tornado damaged several homes in Jeffersonville, Indiana before crossing the Ohio River and striking Prospect, Kentucky resulting in 22 injuries. Further south in Georgia, an EF2 tornado struck the city of Conyers, causing considerable damage and two injuries. In total, 86 tornadoes were confirmed causing over 37 injuries. [6]. Widespread flooding occurred as a part of the storm system, with hourly rainfall rates of 1.5 in (38 mm) in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 1. Severe storms across the Northeastern United States on April 3 produced a daily rainfall record of 1.75 in (44 mm) of precipitation at LaGuardia Airport in New York City. The storm system left roughly 123,000 customers without power in West Virginia [74]. While no tornado-related fatalities occurred, at least five people were killed as a result of the storm system and several others were injured [75]. 

## April 9–11 (United States)

A small severe weather outbreak produced numerous tornadoes along the Gulf Coast. On April 9, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk of severe weather from Central Texas through western Louisiana, including a 10% risk for tornadoes. On April 10, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk for south-central Louisiana into southern Mississippi, with a 15% risk for strong tornadoes. During the very early morning of April 10, a squall line produced a brief EF1 tornado in Katy, Texas and another, stronger EF2 tornado in downtown Port Arthur. Afterwards, a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) formed in eastern Texas, producing twin EF1 tornadoes south of Lake Charles and a damaging EF2 tornado near McNeese State University. The final significant tornado of the outbreak touched down near Lake Pontchartrain, causing EF2 damage on the southern side of Slidell and injuring several people in the area before it dissipated northwest of Pearlington as the tornado was absorbed by an EF1 tornado that moved through Northern Slidell before occluding into Stennis Space Center. Simultaneously, a long-track high-end EF1 tornado touched down in the southern side of Pearl River before striking Gainesville, Mississippi and the Stennis Space Center, causing moderate damage. In addition to the tornadoes that day, flooding near Pittsburgh led to a flash flood emergency. In total, 37 tornadoes were confirmed from the outbreak, with no fatalities and several injuries, as well as $1.5 billion in damages [78]. 

## April 16–18 (United States)

A moderately severe weather outbreak produced numerous tornadoes across the Central Plains into the Midwest. On April 15, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk into Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota, with a 10% hatched tornado risk. On the morning of April 16, multiple supercells from the previous day produced several tornadoes across Iowa and Missouri. A long-lived EF1 tornado passed through the southeastern side of Eureka, Kansas, causing significant damage to barns. After this tornado dissipated, a supercell to the north produced three weak but long-tracked tornadoes southwest of Overbrook. The same cell produced a stronger EF2 tornado south of Virgil, which caused significant damage to barns and telephone poles. Later that morning, another enhanced risk was issued for Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri, with an additional 30% hatched risk for large hail. Only weak tornadoes touched down for most of the day, but the final one that day was a long-tracked, high-end EF2 tornado that touched down near Houghton before moving through rural areas near New London. This strong tornado, which was the strongest of the outbreak, caused severe damage at several houses' farmsteads near Yarmouth and uprooted numerous trees at Port Louisa National Wildlife Refuge before dissipating near Toolesboro. Weak tornadoes occurred over the next two days before the outbreak ended. In total, 50 tornadoes were confirmed from this outbreak, causing no injuries or fatalities. 

## April 19 (Alaska)

A very rare EF0 tornado occurred near Rusty Point, just outside of Anchorage, Alaska, marking the fifth officially recorded tornado to occur in the state. It remained over remote areas and caused no damage. This was also the first Alaskan tornado recorded since 2005 [6]. 

## April 25–28 (United States)

A devastating tornado outbreak occurred across the central United States at the end of April. On April 26, several lines of supercells impacted eastern Nebraska and western and central Iowa, producing widespread tornado damage. A large EF3 wedge tornado passed near Elba, Nebraska, causing major damage at a farmstead. Shortly after, a cyclic supercell produced a large EF3 tornado near Lincoln, Nebraska that struck an industrial building while 70 people were inside, resulting in the building's collapse and at least three non-fatal injuries [82]. The tornado then derailed a BNSF freight train and crossed I-80 before dissipating. After spawning some weak, short-lived tornadoes, the same storm produced a very large, violent low-end EF4 wedge tornado that touched down near Yutan, Nebraska and tracked through the northwestern Omaha metropolitan area and near Blair, prompting a tornado emergency [83] [84]. Significant damage was observed in Elkhorn from the tornado, with multiple homes being leveled and swept away with many other homes sustaining loss of roofs and collapsed walls [85]. More than 100 homes were destroyed and four people were injured [86] [87]. The Omaha Public Power District reported that the tornado outbreak left more than 10,000 homes without power, though half of those affected had power return by the following morning [88]. Later, another storm produced an EF3 tornado that was documented by multiple surveillance cameras while passing through the east side of Council Bluffs, Iowa [89]. The tornado then crossed the Missouri River and struck Omaha, Nebraska's airport, Eppley Airfield, damaging or destroying several general aviation buildings. The tornado then crossed back over the Missouri River and reached its peak intensity near Crescent, Iowa, destroying a home [90] [91]. The tornado continued to cause damage before dissipating near Beebeetown. Another long-tracked, very large high-end EF3 tornado struck Minden, prompting another tornado emergency [92]. An estimated 40–50 homes were destroyed in Minden, where one person was killed and three others were injured. The tornado also caused damage near Tennant, Harlan, and Defiance before dissipating [83]. That night, an EF2 tornado prompted another PDS warning for Pleasant Hill southeast of Des Moines [93]. Major damage to homes occurred and one person was injured. The next day, another major outbreak broke out across parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. The strongest tornadoes struck Southern Oklahoma during the nighttime hours after a line of strong supercells developed in front of a squall line [96]. A high-end EF3 tornado struck Sulphur, severely damaging or destroying homes and killing one person. Later, another EF3 tornado passed through or near Spaulding, Holdenville, and Bearden, causing major damage and killing two people. Another large, violent EF4 tornado struck Marietta, causing major damage to a Dollar Tree distribution center, and killing one person [97]. The next day, multiple tornadoes struck eastern Texas and southeastern Oklahoma. Although all the tornadoes were weak, one brief EF1 tornado impacted a subdivision of Trinity, Texas, destroying a mobile home [98]. Both occupants were injured, with one of them later dying from his injuries. The tornado also damaged trees and vehicles. Overall, 164 tornadoes, six fatalities, and more than 150 injuries were confirmed during the outbreak [99] [100]. 

## April 27 (China)

A significant tornado moved through several villages in the Baiyun District of Guangzhou, killing five people, and injuring dozens of others. More than 140 factory buildings sustained a certain degree of damage. 

## April 30 – May 4 (United States)

On April 30, the Storm Prediction Center issued an Enhanced risk for severe weather in the states of Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, including a 5% risk for tornadoes. During the mid-afternoon, a low-precipitation supercell spawned an intense, multiple-vortex tornado that struck Westmoreland, Kansas, causing extensive damage to homes and businesses. Two poorly constructed frame homes were destroyed, and as a result, a low-end EF3 rating was applied, with wind speeds estimated at 140 mph (230 km/h). One fatality occurred in a destroyed mobile home as well. A photogenic tornado struck south of Vermillion, Kansas, heavily damaging one home at high-end EF1 intensity [102]. In the early evening, a high-end EF1 tornado directly struck New Cordell, Oklahoma, damaging numerous homes and businesses. Later in the evening, a powerful supercell displayed an intense tornado vortex signature east of Hollister, Oklahoma. Given this tornado occurred in a rural area, the lack of damage indicators for it to hit led to a high-end EF1 rating. The tornado is believed to have been much more powerful than EF1 intensity,  and has been described as "one of the most powerful tornadoes ever to occur" by Oklahoma Country station KLAW, as well as certain meteorologists and storm chasers [103]. The same supercell spawned an anticyclonic EF1 tornado southeast of Loveland,   which was also believed to be more powerful than EF1 intensity  in contrast to most anti-cyclonic tornadoes, which are typically much weaker [104] [105] [106] [107]. An analysis of the Hollister and Loveland tornadoes by forecaster Trey Greenwood indicated that the Hollister tornado could have likely produced damage up to EF3 intensity, but stated that it was unlikely to have been a violent (EF4+) tornado, whereas the Loveland satellite tornado may have approached the intensity of the parent Hollister tornado and likely produced wind speeds in the range of 95–140 mph (153–225 km/h) while exhibiting a reversed hook echo [108]. On May 1, multiple weak tornadoes touched down in and around Spearman, Texas; an unrelated rare EF0 tornado also occurred in Puerto Rico. On May 2, the Storm Prediction Center issued an Enhanced risk for severe weather in the state of Texas, with a 5% risk for tornadoes [6]. Numerous tornadoes touched down, the strongest being a "drill bit" high-end EF3 tornado that struck west of Hawley, Texas. Power poles and outbuildings sustained significant damage near the start of its path. As the tornado deviated south, it struck a poorly-constructed home, sweeping it clean off its foundation. Another home, more well-constructed, was struck as the tornado continued to move south. All of its walls collapsed, with debris partially swept off the foundation. All four occupants sustained injuries. Vehicles were thrown and severely damaged as well [110]. On May 3, the Storm Prediction Center issued yet another Enhanced risk for severe weather. Several tornadoes touched down throughout the day, including an EF2 tornado south of Silver, Texas and a deviant low-end EF3 wedge tornado south of Robert Lee. The storms have also been associated with severe flooding in Texas, which resulted in at least 224 people being rescued from their homes and vehicles in Harris County by May 3. BNSF's Fort Worth Subdivision was closed for a few days after severe flooding caused a washout near Clifton;  it was later closed again when the first train to go over the line after it reopened derailed [112] [113]. Amtrak's Texas Eagle was forced to operate a bus bridge between San Antonio and Fort Worth, Texas and later between Temple and Fort Worth [114]. Five more tornadoes touched down south of Fort Stockton, Texas on May 4 [115]. They generally moved over rural, inaccessible open terrain, but one of them was rated EF2 tornado due to snapping power poles; the others were rated EFU. Another EF2 tornado caused considerable damage on a ranch in Crockett County. One other EFU tornado also occurred in Ohio that day. In all, 51 tornadoes were confirmed [6]. 

# May

## May 6–10 (United States)

Another large and deadly tornado outbreak occurred across the Great Plains, Mississippi Valley, and the Ohio Valley from May 6–10. On May 6, a tornado-driven high risk was issued by the Storm Prediction Center across central, north central, and, later, northeastern Oklahoma and south central Kansas, highlighting a 30 percent significant tornado probability over the High Risk area. However, throughout the day, only weak tornadoes occurred across the Plains. A separate system also spawned severe thunderstorms in Tennessee, including one that produced an EF1 tornado that moved through Smithville. Later that night, a powerful supercell spawned a violent EF4 tornado southeast of Hominy, Oklahoma. The tornado moved northeastward and struck the community of Barnsdall, prompting the issuance of a tornado emergency. Two people were killed within the town, and many homes and other structures were heavily damaged or destroyed, including some that were leveled. The tornado continued northeast and moved into Bartlesville, Oklahoma, causing additional severe damage before dissipating northeast of the town. Through the overnight hours into May 7, a squall line produced widespread damaging winds and isolated weak tornadoes across all of Missouri [116] [117] [118]. On May 7, a tornado-driven Enhanced risk was issued across the Ohio Valley by the Storm Prediction Center [119]. That afternoon, a strong, high-end EF2 tornado caused severe damage in Portage, Michigan. Later, a large EF2 tornado along with a satellite EF1 tornado prompted the issuance of a tornado emergency for Union City and Sherwood, the first tornado emergency ever issued in the state of Michigan. Other tornadoes were reported across Michigan along with Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Arkansas, and Pennsylvania through the overnight hours into May 8. Later on May 8, more severe weather and tornadoes impacted much of the Middle Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys with many areas experiencing multiple rounds of storms. PDS tornado warnings were issued for EF1 tornadoes near Equality, Illinois and Aurora, Missouri. A tornado emergency was issued for a large, low-end EF3 tornado east of Columbia, Tennessee; a fatality and four injuries have been confirmed with this tornado. Later in the evening, an intense, low-end EF3 tornado crossed Wheeler Lake southeast of Rogersville, Alabama and came ashore in the Bridgadoon subdivision [121]. It damaged several homes, including one large home that sustained significant damage. That night, another PDS tornado warning was issued when the same storm that produced the Brigadoon tornado spawned a strong EF2 tornado in Huntsville, Alabama; the same storm later produced another destructive low-end EF3 tornado that prompted the issuance of another tornado emergency for Henagar, Hammondville, and Mentone. Strong straight-line winds blew a tree down on a car east of Lone Mountain, Tennessee, killing the driver. Severe storms also forced a Major League Baseball game at Busch Stadium to be postponed until August 5 [122]. More isolated tornadic activity occurred on May 9, but widespread reports of wind damage and large to very large hail were recorded throughout the Deep South [123]. Through the overnight hours into May 10, a severe MCS moved through the southern Gulf Coast, producing widespread wind damage. The MCS would produce an EF2 tornado northeast of Pensacola, Florida before spawning three large tornadoes that simultaneously impacted Leon County, Florida [124]. The two northern-most tornadoes, which were both rated low-end EF2, moved directly through Tallahassee, inflicting major damage to the downtown area as well as on the campuses of Florida State University and Florida A&M University. The second of these tornadoes also killed two people. To the south of these tornadoes, a swath of significant straight-line winds of around 100 mph (160 km/h) caused damage in the southern part of Tallahassee and points east. The third tornado, which was rated high-end EF1, passed south of Tallahassee, producing widespread tree damage. Tornadic activity then ceased, but severe weather continued to impact the Southeastern United States until the system finally pushed offshore early on May 11 [124] [125]. In all, 174 tornadoes, five tornadic fatalities, and three non-tornadic fatalities were confirmed from this outbreak [126]. 

## May 10 (Australia)

An EF2 tornado struck the town of Bunbury, damaging around 100 homes, including seven that were declared uninhabitable, and injuring two people. 

## May 13–14 (United States)

Severe storms produced damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes across mainly the Gulf Coast. The strongest tornadoes were spawned in association with an MCS that moved through the Acadiana region of Louisiana. An EF2 tornado impacted the eastern part of Sulphur, destroying warehouses and damaging homes, other structures, trees, and power lines [130]. As that tornado dissipated, an EF1 tornado developed in Westlake and moved through Downtown Lake Charles, damaging homes, businesses, trees and power lines [131]. Later, another EF2 tornado crossed over I-10 and moved through Henderson, damaging homes and businesses, rolling mobile homes and RV, destroying outbuildings, and damaging trees and power lines [132]. The tornado killed one person and injured another person. An unrelated EF0 tornado also occurred in Arizona [131]. Scattered tornadic weather occurred on May 14 as well, although all the tornadoes were weak [133]. In all, 26 tornadoes were confirmed [6] [134].

## May 19–27 (United States)

An extended period of significant tornado outbreaks and tornado activity along with two derechos rounded out the very active month of May starting on May 19. On May 19, severe weather produced destructive hurricane-force straight-line winds, very large hail, and numerous tornadoes across mainly Kansas and Oklahoma. One large EF2 tornado prompted the issuance of a tornado emergency for Custer City, Oklahoma while another EF2 tornado passed near Yukon. On May 21, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Moderate risk for severe weather in the states of Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois, including a 15% hatched risk for significant, long-track tornadoes [141] [142]. As a result, a Particularly Dangerous Situation tornado watch was issued [143]. A few tornadoes occurred near Macedonia and Red Oak [144]. One long-tracked and violent tornado touched down near Villisca, Iowa. Continuing northeast, it toppled and crumpled several wind turbines. The tornado then approached Greenfield, where it intensified to EF4 intensity [145]. Numerous homes were damaged or destroyed with some of them being reduced to their foundations or swept clean [146] [147]. Vehicles sustained severe damage as well and multiple trees were severely debarked. Four people were killed in Greenfield. Another fatality occurred near the town of Corning, about 30 miles southwest of Greenfield when the tornado blew a vehicle off the road. At least 35 people sustained injuries to some degree. A Doppler on Wheels measured 309–318 mph (497–512 km/h) winds in a small area between 30–50 m (98–164 ft) above the surface near Greenfield making this one of the highest windspeeds ever recorded in a tornado [148]. Tornadic activity continued over the next several days. During the overnight hours of May 25 into May 26, several destructive tornadoes touched down in northern Texas from an isolated supercell. One destructive and intense low-end EF3 tornado caused severe damage near Valley View and Pilot Point, Texas, killing at least seven people and injuring 100 others. Further to the north, supercell clusters formed and moved eastward across southeastern Kansas and northeastern Oklahoma as well as northern Arkansas and southern Missouri, causing widespread destruction from both tornadoes and damaging straight-line winds of up to 100 mph (160 km/h) [150] [151] [152]. Another destructive EF3 tornado struck Claremore and near Pryor, Oklahoma, killing two people. An EF3 tornado near Decatur, Arkansas became the largest tornado ever recorded in the state while secondary circulation spawned a damaging anticyclonic EF2 tornado [153]. A strong EF2 tornado also struck Rogers, causing major damage [154]. A total of four people were killed by an EF3 tornado neat Olvey and Pyatt,   another tornadic fatality occurred when a low-end EF3 tornado struck Briarcliff (which was also struck by an EF2 satellite tornado),  and two indirect fatalities occurred with a low-end EF3 tornado that moved through Sikeston, Missouri [154] [155] [156]. In the evening hours of May 26, a large and destructive high-end EF3 tornado prompted four tornado emergencies as it impacted Crider, Charleston, and Barnsley, causing significant damage and a fatality. In all, 240 tornadoes and 21 tornadic fatalities were confirmed from the outbreak sequence, along with 10 additional non-tornadic fatalities. 

## May 23 (Mexico)

The SPC issued an enhanced risk of severe weather over part of West Texas mainly for the threat of damaging winds and large hail, however, a 5% tornado risk was also included. That evening, numerous tornadoes touched down in Texas, including an EF2 tornado that prompted a tornado emergency for areas to the south of Midland, damaging power poles and RVs [159]. This was the first issuance of a tornado emergency by the National Weather Service office in Midland. An EF3 tornado damaged heavy oil equipment and caused ground scouring near Midkiff. Further east, multiple EF1 tornadoes touched down near the Texas-Louisiana border, including a tornado near Stonewall, Louisiana that tossed a metal building [160] [161]. This outbreak produced 13 tornadoes but no casualties [162].

The tornado was filmed from multiple angles and damaged 34 buildings. A weak barn was completely destroyed, giving it an IF2 rating. Later into the evening, a cyclic supercell moved across central Germany, spawning at least three tornadoes. The first one affected mostly rural areas near Hohenbüchen, where large-scale blowdown of a birch forest yielded an IF1.5 rating. Shortly after, another tornado touched down and caused some roof damage in the town of Bockenem, which was rated IF1. The third and final tornado from this storm was also the strongest, being rated IF2. As it moved south of Heere, it completely debranched trees and left cycloidal marks in fields. The next day, a weak tornado struck a forest and nearby roads in a ski resort near Chalmazel, in France, injuring one person.
