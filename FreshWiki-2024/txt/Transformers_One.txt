Transformers_One

Transformers One is a 2024 American animated science fiction action film based on Hasbro's Transformers toy line. It was directed by Josh Cooley from a screenplay by Eric Pearson, Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari, the latter two of whom also conceived the film's story. The film features voices of Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Steve Buscemi, Laurence Fishburne, and Jon Hamm, It is set on Cybertron, the home planet of the Transformers, and depicts the origins and early relationship of Optimus Prime and Megatron. 
In March 2015, following the release of Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014), Paramount Pictures tasked Akiva Goldsman to set up a writers' room to create ideas for potential future Transformers films. By May 2015, Barrer and Ferrari had signed on as writers, and they came up with the idea of an animated prequel set on Cybertron. The film was announced in August 2017, and by April 2020, Cooley had been hired to direct. Animation services were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, and the design was primarily influenced by the Generation 1 era and Art Deco. The score was composed by Brian Tyler.
Transformers One premiered in Sydney, Australia, on September 11, 2024, and was released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on September 20. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the story, animation, voice performances, action sequences, score, and humor, but underperformed at the box office, grossing $129.4 million worldwide on a budget of $75–147 million.

# Plot

Cybertron is a technological world inhabited by sentient robots fuelled by a substance called Energon and born with transformation cogs, organs that allow them to transform into vehicles. In the underground city of Iacon, Orion Pax, a mining robot without a cog, sneaks into an archive to watch a documentary on the Primes, the first Cybertronians made by their creator Primus. Security guards catch Orion, but his best friend, D-16, bails him out. Later, a cave-in occurs in the Energon mine where the two work, trapping fellow miner Jazz. While Orion and D-16 save him, their callous overseer, Darkwing, blames the incident on their superior, Elita-1, and demotes her.. Cybertron's leader, Sentinel Prime, returns from an expedition to the planet's surface to find the lost Matrix of Leadership, the absence of which caused Energon to stop flowing; thus forcing the miners to extract it. Though unable to find it, he reprieves the population with a race. To prove themselves more than miners, Orion enters himself and D-16 illegally using jet packs but they lose. While Sentinel promises to reward them for boosting mining morale, an enraged Darkwing drags them to garbage incineration for upstaging him in the race, where they meet the eccentric B-127. Discovering a chip among the junk containing a distress message from Alpha Trion, one of the Primes, Orion convinces D-16 and B-127 to travel with him to his coordinates on the surface; they also persuade Elita to join when she catches them sneaking out of Iacon.. Eventually, they find a deactivated Trion in a cave alongside the corpses of the other Primes. Upon reactivation, he reveals that Sentinel betrayed the Primes to steal the Matrix, only for it to disappear due to Primus deeming him unworthy. In truth, Sentinel has been giving Energon to Cybertron's enemies, the Quintessons, in exchange for letting him rule the planet while creating the miner class by removing their cogs before activation. Trion provides the group with cogs, allowing them to transform, and a chip carrying evidence of Sentinel's treason. Sentinel's forces then arrive, capturing Trion and bringing him to Sentinel, who executes him.. Evading their pursuers, the team travels back to Iacon but is captured en route by the Primes' former warbots, the High Guard, who are rebelling against Sentinel. While D-16 takes command of the High Guard by defeating their leader, Starscream, Orion is concerned by his friend's aggression since learning the truth. Sentinel's forces find them, and in the ensuing battle, the evidence chip is destroyed while D-16, B-127, and Starscream are captured, along with half the High Guard. Taken back to Iacon, D-16 is branded with the face of his idol, Megatronus Prime, after learning that Sentinel took his cog.. Orion, encouraged by Elita, rallies the remaining High Guard members and returns to Iacon to rescue their comrades. Once there, Orion convinces the miners to revolt and frees the captives while Elita exposes Sentinel by broadcasting memory recordings of his lieutenant, Airachnid, throughout the city. D-16 subdues Sentinel but gets into an argument with Orion over whether to execute him, resulting in D-16 accidentally shooting Orion before ultimately letting his friend fall to his death. D-16 then bisects Sentinel, takes Megatronus' cog, renames himself Megatron, and starts a riot with the High Guard.. Deeming Orion worthy, Primus and the spirits of the Primes bestow him with the Matrix, reviving him as Optimus Prime, who proceeds to defeat Megatron before exiling him alongside the High Guard. The Matrix then restores the miners' cogs and makes Energon flow again. Now Cybertron's new leader, Optimus christens his followers as Autobots and sends a message to the Quintessons, warning them to stay away. Meanwhile, Megatron reforms the High Guard into the Decepticons, using Megatronus' face as their insignia, and starts a rebellion against Optimus' leadership.. 

# Production

## Development

Following the release of Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014), Paramount Pictures tasked Akiva Goldsman in March 2015 to work with the film franchise's director Michael Bay, executive producer Steven Spielberg, and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura to set up a writers' room to create ideas for future Transformers films. According to Goldsman, the writing team would look at various Transformers media created by Hasbro for inspiration; if they found one that interested them, they could submit a treatment, which would then be further developed by the whole team [7]. In late May, the team of Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari signed on as writers [8]. According to Deadline Hollywood, one of the ideas from the writer's room had the working title Transformers One  and would serve as an animated prequel focusing on the Autobot–Decepticon conflict that began on Cybertron [9]. In August 2017, it was reported that an animated Transformers film was officially in the works. Following the release of Bumblebee (2018), di Bonaventura discussed the animated film, clarifying that it was "in the works" and would "tell the whole Cybertron mythology" [12]. Bumblebee director Travis Knight additionally expressed interest in the film [13]. In April 2020, it was reported that former Pixar animator and filmmaker Josh Cooley had been hired to direct the film and was overseeing the script by Barrer and Ferrari. Hasbro Entertainment and Paramount Animation would produce the film. In February 2022, it emerged that the film would be computer-animated [16]. In December 2022, the title was reported to be Transformers: A New Generation, though di Bonaventura later stated in April 2023 that the title had yet to be finalized [17]. Later that month, at CinemaCon, the title was officially confirmed as Transformers One [18] [19]. di Bonaventura stated that the plot will center around the origins of the Transformers, and explore the events that lead Optimus and Megatron to go from being brothers-in-arms to becoming enemies [20]. The budget was reportedly $75 million,   although an Animation Magazine interview with Cooley and di Bonaventura put the cost of production as high as $147 million [21] [2] [3]. 

## Writing

Eric Pearson, Barrer, and Ferrari received screenplay credit, with Barrer and Ferrari receiving story credits. When Cooley joined the project, Hasbro gave him a bible that covered the lore for the entire franchise [22] [23]. Cooley wanted to capture an "epic quality" and grand scale for the film and used The Transformers: The Movie (1986) and Dune (1965) as points of reference [24]. As there are no human characters in Transformers One as they are in previous films in the franchise, Cooley and the team aimed to "inject more comedy and humanity" into the Transformers themselves [25]. They wanted to make sure that the characters had enough humor and emotion to carry the story on their own. The film depicts how the Transformers gained the ability to transform, an idea Cooley found appealing [25]. He felt that there was fun in seeing the characters learn and adapt to their new powers. The relationship between Optimus Prime and Megatron and the tragedy of their falling out is the emotional core of the film. For Cooley, it was important to show that Megatron was not just a villain. He wanted people who did not know Transformers to come into the film and not be able to immediately pick up who was going to be good or bad. He took inspiration from several famous brothers-turned-enemies stories from across pop culture when crafting the arc [24]. As a reference to his previous origin story, the film originally included a scene depicting Megatron as a gladiator, to have him and Optimus Prime come from completely different backgrounds [26]. Due to runtime constraints, that idea was scrapped and they were both made to be coworkers in the mines instead. 

## Casting and voice recording

The voice cast of the film was announced at CinemaCon in April 2023, consisting of Chris Hemsworth and Brian Tyree Henry as younger versions of Optimus Prime and Megatron, alongside Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Jon Hamm, and Laurence Fishburne headlining. In April 2024, Steve Buscemi, who had previously voiced Daytrader in Transformers: The Last Knight (2017), was cast as Starscream [20]. Cooley desired to get a voice cast as impressive as that of The Transformers: The Movie [28] [29] [30]. Transformers One was Hemsworth's first animated feature film. He joined the project after being impressed with the screenplay. Hemsworth made efforts to not use his regular speaking voice for Optimus Prime [31]. Many of Hemsworth's lines in the film were "riff offs" from what the filmmakers wrote, bringing his charisma and comedy to them [31]. From a fan's point of view, di Bonaventura felt important to respect longtime Optimus Prime actor Peter Cullen's performance while not bringing him back to ensure the audience felt Prime's youth, leading to Hemsworth's casting, who surprised di Bonaventura with his "very strong sense of story". Cooley's desire to harken back to the chattier version of Bumblebee seen in other Transformers media influenced Key's casting, who he had worked with before when directing Pixar's Toy Story 4 (2019). Cooley requested that Key stay close to his regular speaking voice for Bumblebee [25]. Johansson was approached to voice Elita by Hemsworth, who texted her upon joining the project himself [33]. The two had previously worked together in several Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films. 

## Animation and design

Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), who had provided the visual effects for the first six live-action Transformers installments, returned to provide the animation for the film. Rob Coleman served as animation supervisor, and Frazier Churchill served as VFX supervisor [35]. Cooley directed the studio to create a visual style for the film that was realistic enough to be believable while still looking like it was crafted by human hands [22] [36]. The designs of the Transformers were heavily influenced by those of Generation 1. Cooley said, "They’re really clear and have these great silhouettes [37]. It was important to hit that."  The team began by looking at the work of original Transformers character designer, Floro Dery [24]. Art Deco was a big influence on the film's production and character design, with Cooley describing the style as being all about post-depression [37]. He felt it to be relevant to the film as it takes place before the planet of Cybertron falls apart and while things are still going well. In order to make the Transformers feel more human and for the audiences to better connect, the team at ILM was instructed to make them more emotive with their faces and character animation [37]. Measures applied to ensure this included making sure their faces were not covered all of the time and making their eyes more expressive [38]. Cooley felt a grand sense of scale was essential to the Transformers brand [25]. As there are no humans in the film to use as a scale reference, the team looked to Cybertron instead and aimed to make it feel larger than life. 

## Music

In May 2024, it was announced that Brian Tyler, who had previously provided the score for the animated television series Transformers: Prime (2010–2013), would compose the score for Transformers One. The soundtrack album features the score and was released by Sony Classical Records and Milan Records on September 20, 2024 [40]. An original song for the film, "If I Fall", written by Tyler and performed by Quavo and Ty Dolla Sign, was released as a single on September 6, 2024 [41]. A second original song, "Together As One", by DJ and producer Excision, was released on September 12, 2024 [42]. 

# Release

Transformers One screened as a work-in-progress at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival on June 10, 2024; audience and social media reactions were reportedly positive. The film premiered in Sydney, Australia on September 11, 2024, and was theatrically released in the United States on September 20, 2024 [44] [45]. It was screened in various formats, including RealD 3D, IMAX, Dolby Cinema, and 4DX [46] [47]. It was originally scheduled to be released on July 19, 2024,  but was initially delayed to September 13,  before shifting a week later to avoid competition with Beetlejuice Beetlejuice [48] [49] [50] [51]. 

## Marketing

The first trailer for Transformers One was released online on April 18, 2024 to positive response. It featured a custom introduction from Hemsworth and Henry, and incorporated the song "Start Me Up" by the Rolling Stones [53]. It made its debut via a spacecraft that was launched 125,000 feet above the Earth [53] [54]. Brian Welk of IndieWire felt that the film looked to have appeal for both younger audiences and longtime Transformers fans [53]. Alex Billington of FirstShowing.net found the trailer amusing and felt that the film had promise, though he opined that it seemed to be more geared towards younger audiences than compared to previous Transformers films [55]. Eric Diaz of Nerdist commented that the incorporation of "Start Me Up" gave the film "a very 2000s DreamWorks Animation vibe."  A second trailer debuted at San Diego Comic-Con on July 25, 2024 [56] [54]. 

## Home media

Transformers One was released on premium video-on-demand services on October 22, 2024, with Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD copies distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment released on December 17, 2024. It was released on the Paramount+ streaming service on November 15, 2024 [57]. 

# Reception

## Box office

Transformers One grossed $59.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $70.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $129.4 million. In the United States and Canada, Transformers One was released alongside The Substance and Never Let Go, and was projected to gross $30–40 million from 3,978 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $9.6 million on its first day, including $3.4 million from Wednesday and Thursday night previews [2] [3]. It went on to debut to $24.6 million, finishing second behind holdover Beetlejuice Beetlejuice [59]. The opening weekend gross was deemed disappointing, but there was optimism that the film would do well over time [60]. In its second weekend, the film had a 62.8% drop, making only $9.2 million and finishing in third [61]. This was attributed to the lack of marketing and interest from families, as well as facing competition from The Wild Robot, which took over in premium format screens [62]. Internationally, the film was released on dates ranging from September 11, 2024 (in Indonesia), to October 24, 2024 (in Israel). In the United Kingdom and Ireland region, where it released on October 11, 2024, the film opened to £1.6 million, ranking it above DC Comics holdover Joker: Folie à Deux [6]. 

## Critical response

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 89% of 168 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's consensus reads: "Dramatically satisfying with a dash of good humor, Transformers One suggests that animation might be the optimal medium for this oft-adapted franchise."  Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews [65]. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it an average five out of five stars, with 75% saying they would definitely recommend it [66]. Todd Gilchrist of Variety praised the film's direction, animation, and screenplay. He felt the film boasted a level of complexity and described it as "the most sophisticated onscreen portrait" of the Transformers to date. G [67]. Allen Johnson of the San Francisco Chronicle compared the film favorably to the live-action installments, applauding its screenplay, visuals, and resonant themes, and describing it as unapologetically made for "the inner child."  Carlos Aguilar of the Los Angeles Times opined that the film benefitted from the quality standard set by prior Transformers films, but still commended it for its screenplay, themes, humor, animation, and emotional core [68]. Adam Graham of The Detroit News awarded the film a B- rating, praising the animation, direction, screenplay, and humor, and comparing it favorably to the live-action installments [69]. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film for its direction, animation, screenplay, and emotional core and felt it to have revitalized the Transformers franchise. Leigh Monson of The A.V [71]. Club awarded the film a B- rating. They commended the story, animation, and voice performances, though felt the film to be predictable and unambitious. Randy Myers of The Mercury News gave the film a 3 out of 4 rating and referred to it as the best of the Paramount Transformers films [72]. They lauded the humor, voice performances, and animation. Tom Jorgensen of IGN rated the film 5 out of 10, praising the voice cast and Brian Tyree Henry's performance, as well as the story of Orion Pax and D-16. Overall he felt the film was underwhelming and was critical of it for being surface-level and featuring illegible action scenes. Soren Andersen of The Seattle Times gave the film a 2 out of 4 star rating [74]. He commended Keegan-Michael Key's performance but felt the film to be overall an exhausting experience due to an overabundance of action scenes. Wilson Chapman of IndieWire gave the film a C grade and said: "It’s all executed competently but joylessly, with zero fun to be had as it labors across an hour and 40 minute runtime that feels both too short and painfully long." [75] [76]. 

# Future

In April 2023, di Bonaventura stated that there is discussion for Transformers One to become a trilogy of films. By June, he confirmed that the story is mapped out to progress over three movies, detailing the progression of the characters into their depiction in the live-action film series [21]. The producer explained that Hemsworth's depiction of Optimus Prime will grow into the leader depicted in the previous installments, stating that the transition from Hemsworth's voice to Peter Cullen's will make sense within the story. In September 2024, di Bonaventura confirmed that they will make a Transformers One sequel if the film turns out a success, with the filmmakers already devising ideas for a character-driven sequel like its predecessor [85]. On November 20, 2024, following the film's underperformance, Hasbro announced that they would no longer be co-financing film adaptations, instead leaving external studios to exclusively fund such projects. The following month, Tyree Henry expressed hopes of a sequel being officially confirmed [87].
