Miss_Universe_2024

Miss Universe 2024 was the 73rd Miss Universe pageant, held at the Arena CDMX in Mexico City, Mexico, on 16 November 2024.
Sheynnis Palacios of Nicaragua crowned Victoria Kjær Theilvig of Denmark as her successor at the end of the event. This was Denmark's first win in the pageant's history.
Contestants from a record 125 countries and territories competed in the pageant, surpassing the previous record of 94 entrants set in 2018.

# Background

## Location and date

On 18 November 2023, at the Miss Universe 2023 pageant, Raúl Rocha Cantú, the owner of Legacy Holding Group USA Inc., announced that the 73rd edition of the Miss Universe pageant would be held in Mexico, marking the first time the country hosted the pageant since 2007. On 24 August 2024, the organizers announced that the pageant would be held at the Mexico City Arena, also known as Arena CDMX, on 16 November, with the preliminary rounds on 14 November. 

## Selection of participants

In September 2023, during the Tanner Fletcher show at New York Fashion Week, Miss Universe 2022 R'Bonney Gabriel confirmed that the Miss Universe Organization had removed age restrictions for contestants over the age of 18, which were introduced following the 2023 pageant. Before this, the pageant had restricted participation to women between ages 18–28 on the year of the pageant, outside of special circumstances. Also, height and weight restrictions were removed. [a] [10]. 

### Replacements

Franki Russell was initially appointed as the representative for New Zealand. However, the franchise owner withdrew her representation and relinquished its franchise, citing non-compliance with guidelines set by the Miss Universe Organization [11]. Subsequently, a new organization was awarded the franchise and Victoria Vincent was named the new representative [12]. Fay Asghari was the original winner of the Miss Universe Persia 2024 pageant, which selects the Iranian representative in Miss Universe. However, Asghari eventually relinquished her crown due to conflict with her work, and was replaced by her first runner-up Ava Vahneshan. [14]. Andrea Radford won Miss Universe Guatemala in July but relinquished her title after becoming pregnant. She was replaced by her first runner-up, Ana Gabriela Villanueva [15]. Irina Zakharova was originally crowned as Miss Universe Armenia 2024 but faced backlash from the Armenian public after being identified as a Russian national. Eventually, the Miss Universe Organization disqualified her, indicating that she had violated rules on the eligibility to participate [17]. She was then replaced by Emma Avanesyan, one of her runner-ups [18]. Emma Heyst originally won the title of Miss Denmark 2024 and was entitled to represent Denmark in the Miss Universe 2024 competition. However, due to inadequate preparation for the event, she withdrew from the competition in September and was replaced by Victoria Kjær Theilvig, who subsequently won the title of Miss Universe 2024. 

### Debuts, returns, and withdrawals

This edition marked the debut of Belarus, Eritrea, Guinea, Iran, [b] Macau, Maldives, Moldova, North Macedonia, Somalia, the United Arab Emirates, and Uzbekistan. Additionally, this edition featured the returns of Cuba, which last competed in 1967; Fiji in 1981;  Guadeloupe and Martinique in 1984;   the Democratic Republic of the Congo (as Zaire), [c] Ivory Coast, and Samoa (as Western Samoa) in 1986;  Senegal in 1987; Gibraltar in 1990;  Bonaire and Suriname in 1999;  Hong Kong in 2000;  Cyprus in 2012; Botswana and Estonia in 2013;  Turks and Caicos in 2014;  Montenegro and Serbia in 2015; Sri Lanka and Zambia in 2018; Bangladesh, New Zealand, Tanzania, and the United States Virgin Islands in 2019;  Israel, Kenya, and Romania in 2021;  and Armenia, Belize, China, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, and Uruguay, which last competed in 2022 [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34]. Italy Mora of Panama was disqualified during the pageant due to leaving the hotel without consent from the Miss Universe Organization. This decision was made by the Disciplinary Committee of Miss Universe Organization jointly  with their local franchise holder [37]. Prior to the preliminary competition, Edona Bajrami of Kosovo and Mia le Roux of South Africa withdrew due to health reasons. 

## New crown

On 14 November, the pageant unveiled the "Lumière de l’Infini" (transl. "The Light of Infinity") as the 13th crown used in the history of the pageant. The crown, provided by Jewelmer, is adorned with diamonds and 23 golden south sea pearls [40]. Created over the span of two years, the crown was crafted by Filipino craftsmen using traditional techniques from Place Vendôme [41]. However, the fact that the material chosen for the new crown came from the Philippines did not please everyone. An indigenous group from the region, where the pearls were collected, Sambilog-Balik Bugsuk Movement, published an open letter to the eventual winner, Kjær Theilvig, condemning the crown designers for its ties to the "suffering of Indigenous Peoples in Bugsuk Island" and urging her to use her platform to highlight the issues faced by marginalized groups around the world.

The preliminary competition, consisting of the swimsuit segment, evening gown and closed-door interviews, determined the semifinalists for the pageant. Four continental queens and one fan-vote winner  automatically advanced to the semifinals. The initial group of semifinalists then competed in the swimsuit segment, from which twelve contestants progressed to the evening gown competition.
