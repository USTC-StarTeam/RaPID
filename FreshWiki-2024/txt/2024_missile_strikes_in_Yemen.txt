2024_missile_strikes_in_Yemen

Since 12 January 2024, the United States of America and the United Kingdom, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, have launched a series of cruise missile and airstrikes, codenamed Operation Poseidon Archer, against the Houthi movement (Ansar Allah) in Yemen in response to Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea. The Houthis had previously declared that their attacks are in support of Palestinians during the Israel–Hamas war; Houthi attacks on shipping were condemned by the United Nations Security Council the day before the initial strike.
US President Joe Biden ordered the strikes, and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak convened his cabinet to authorize British participation. American officials said the strikes were intended to degrade Houthi capabilities to attack Red Sea targets rather than to kill leaders and Iranian trainers.
As of 2 May, the Houthis recorded 452 American and British airstrikes against its sites in Yemen, resulting in 40 deaths and 35 injuries.

# Background

On 16 February 2021, the Biden administration removed Ansar Allah, the formal political and military organization of the Houthi movement, from the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) blacklist,  due to concerns that the designation would impede the delivery of humanitarian aid amid Yemen's worsening political and socioeconomic crisis, as the Houthis controlled much of the most populated territory in Yemen [53]. In April 2022, the United Nations brokered a ceasefire between the Houthis and Yemen's internationally recognized Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), which, despite formally lapsing the following October, continues to hold as of December 2023 [22]. With the start of the Israel–Hamas war in October 2023, the Iran-backed, [b] Houthi-controlled Supreme Political Council declared its support for Hamas and began launching attacks on commercial ships transiting the Red Sea, especially in the Bab el-Mandeb, the narrow strait that connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. While the Houthis initially claimed to target only commercial ships bound for Israeli ports or with some link to Israel,  they soon began indiscriminately targeting vessels, attempting attacks on ships with no discernible Israeli ties [25]. Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi warned that "Israel is giving the world some time to organize in order to prevent this but if there isn't to be a global arrangement, because it is a global issue, we will act in order to remove this naval siege."  To launch attacks on Red Sea shipping, the Houthis use coastal missile batteries, loitering munitions, and fast attack craft armed with light autocannons, machine guns, and anti-tank missiles [27] [28]. By 21 December 2023, the Port of Eilat, which gives Israel via the Red Sea its only easy shipping access to Asia without the need to transit the Suez Canal, had seen an 85% drop in activity due to the Houthi action. Before the Houthi attack on the freighter Maersk Hangzhou on 30 December 2023, the United States had shot down a total of 24 Houthi missiles and drones  and deployed naval ships to protect Red Sea shipping lanes, but had not engaged directly with the Houthis [31]. A considerable number of freighters have continued to transit, with mostly large container ships diverting away rather than other shipping, with the strait continuing to be heavily used by bulk carriers and tankers which are under different contract arrangements and often from countries supportive of Gaza's situation so perceiving a minimal risk from ongoing Houthi attacks. In the first week of January 2024 the average number of freighters active each day in the Red Sea included 105 bulk carriers and 58 tankers, down from 115 bulk carriers and 70 tankers the week before [33] [34]. In contrast, six of the ten largest container shipping companies were largely avoiding the Red Sea,  with relatively few container ships transiting the Bab al-Mandeb strait from 18 December 2023 [35] [36]. As of January 2024, most marine insurances require a warranty of no Israeli involvement to insure vessels for the Red Sea route, with some requiring warranties of no US or UK interest and no calls to Israeli ports in the last 12 months. On 3 January 2024, the United States and a group of countries issued an ultimatum to the Houthis to stop their activities. In the days leading up to the strike, members of the US Congress and The Pentagon demanded a strong and deterrent response to the Houthis [39]. One day before the strike, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution condemning Houthi activities in the Red Sea, in which Russia, China, Algeria and Mozambique abstained [40].

Two US officials, speaking to The New York Times, estimated that the strikes had damaged or destroyed about 20 to 30 percent of the Houthis' offensive capability. Despite damaging or destroying about 90 percent of the selected targets struck, the officials added that locating Houthi targets had proved to be more challenging than anticipated.

# Reactions

## Domestic

### Yemeni government

The internationally recognized Government of Yemen issued a statement to Saba News Agency strongly condemning military actions by the Houthis blaming them for "dragging the country into a military confrontation arena for propaganda purposes" and "misleadingly linking it to support for Palestinians".. The government reaffirmed its right to enhance security in the Red Sea region, saying stability there and globally "cannot be achieved except by restoring the legitimate state institutions in Yemen." Reaffirming its support for the Palestinian cause, the Yemeni government warned that "the Israeli aggression in occupied territories risks further destabilizing the region and threatening international peace and security". In an interview with Agence France-Presse, Aidarus al-Zubaidi, vice president of the Presidential Leadership Council and president of the Southern Transitional Council, said that the missile strikes were not enough to deter the Houthi attacks and said that "an international and regional alliance is necessary to secure international navigation in the Red Sea." He also urged foreign forces to support government forces in launching a ground operation against the Houthis in conjunction with the strikes. 

### Houthi movement

Houthi deputy foreign minister Hussein al-Izzi called the attacks "blatant aggression" and said the US and UK would "pay a heavy price" in an interview with Al-Masirah. Similarly, high-ranking Houthi official Ali al-Qahoum vowed there would be retaliation [3]. Mohammed Abdulsalam, a spokesman for the group, announced that the Houthis would continue to target Israeli ships or any ships heading to "the ports of occupied Palestine," saying that the US and UK were wrong to think that the strikes "would deter Yemen from supporting Palestine and Gaza" [1]. Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a senior Houthi official, stated, "Every individual in this world is faced with two choices that have no third: Either to stand with the victims of genocide or to stand with its perpetrators." [169]. Following the initial strikes on 12 January, protests attended by hundreds of thousands of people were held in Sanaa and in other Houthi-controlled cities such as Hodeida and Ibb, to denounce the US and British military actions, with demonstrators chanting "Death to America" and "Death to Israel". Following China Ocean Shipping Company, the fourth largest shipping company, and its container shipping subsidiary OOCL stopping all services to Israel,  a senior Houthi official said Chinese and Russian vessels not connected with Israel will have safe passage [171]. 

## Participants

### United States

Reactions from the US Congress were mixed, with some supporting the strikes and others condemning Biden for using military force without congressional approval. Some critics said that in accordance with Article 1 of the Constitution, Biden needed to seek authorization from Congress before initiating military action. Under Article Two of the United States Constitution, the president has the limited authority to take defensive military action without Congressional approval, though supporters and opponents of the strikes disagree that the strikes can be considered defensive [173]. Legal experts have argued that ambiguity in existing law allows for Congress to place limits on the president's authority to take military action without its approval. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell welcomed the action but said the president's decision was overdue [174]. Biden said that he has sent a message to Iran with the Yemen strikes [173]. Joe Biden stated that the "defensive action follows this extensive diplomatic campaign and Houthi rebels' escalating attacks against commercial vessels" and added that he would "not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary". Following the airstrike on 13 January, Biden said that the US had sent a "private message" to Iran regarding the Houthis [176]. Protesters from Code Pink and the ANSWER Coalition gathered outside the White House several hours after the strikes. In New York City, pro-Palestinian protestors gathered at Times Square. On 17 January, the Biden administration restored the Houthi movement to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorist entities, but did not redesignate it as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. According to a survey conducted by the Harvard CAPS–Harris Poll on 17–18 January 2024, 74% of American respondents supported strikes against the Houthis in Yemen. 

### United Kingdom

Rishi Sunak said that the strikes stemmed from the principle of self-defense. He also confirmed that the UK received non-operational assistance and support from the Netherlands, Canada, and Bahrain. The UK noted that initial indications suggest the Houthis' ability to threaten commercial shipping has "taken a blow". The Liberal Democrats and the Green Party of England and Wales criticized the Sunak government for bypassing parliament, while the leader of the Scottish National Party in the House of Commons, Stephen Flynn, said that it was "incumbent upon the UK Government to appraise Parliament as soon as possible and MPs must therefore be recalled to Westminster" [8]. According to a YouGov poll conducted on 15–16 January 2024, 53% of British respondents supported the government's decision to launch strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, while 22% opposed. 

## Shipping organizations

The Baltic and International Maritime Council (BIMCO), which covers 62% of world shipping tonnage, recommended that its members halt Red Sea transit for up to 72 hours as a result of the strikes. The International Association of Independent Tanker Owners (Intertanko) recommended that its members halt Red Sea transit for up to 24 hours. 

## Energy companies

QatarEnergy, the world's second largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, suspended sending tankers through the Red Sea. The LNG tankers were forced to sail around Africa via the Cape of Good Hope to avoid the war zone [213] [214]. 

## Relief organizations

A joint statement by 26 humanitarian organizations operating in Yemen raised concerns that the military escalation "will only worsen the situation for vulnerable civilians and hinder the ability of aid organisations to deliver critical services." It also urged all parties "to prioritise diplomatic channels over military options to de-escalate the crisis and safeguard the progress of peace efforts in Yemen." [216].
