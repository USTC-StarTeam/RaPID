2024_Stanley_Cup_Finals

The 2024 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2023–24 season and the culmination of the 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Eastern Conference champion Florida Panthers defeated the Western Conference champion Edmonton Oilers four games to three in the best-of-seven series, earning their first championship in their thirty year history.
The series began on June 8, and ended on June 24. The Panthers had home-ice advantage in the series as the team with the better regular season record. This was the fifth consecutive Finals featuring a team from Florida.
This was the furthest distance between two cities for a Finals matchup in NHL history with 4,089 kilometres (2,541 miles), breaking the previous record of 4,023 kilometres (2,500 miles) set by the Vancouver Canucks and Boston Bruins in 2011. This was the first Finals since 1945 to see a team force a seventh game after being down 3–0, with Florida becoming the first team since that occurrence to win the title in seven games after nearly surrendering a 3–0 series lead.  This was also the first Stanley Cup Finals since 2018 where no games went to overtime, and the first since 2019 in which the losing team scored more goals (the Oilers outscored the Panthers 23–18 in the series).

Luostarinen continued to play in the game [43]. Whilst on the subsequent five-minute power play, defenceman Oliver Ekman-Larsson was penalized for tripping, resulting in a four-on-four, during which an Oilers rush resulted in their first shot from Mattias Ekholm going past goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky for a 1–0 lead [43]. In the second period, Niko Mikkola tied the game for the Panthers, taking a drop-pass from Anton Lundell and snapping a shot past Edmonton goaltender Stuart Skinner [44] [45].

In the second period, Oilers forward Adam Henrique passed to Warren Foegele, who scored on a breakaway to tie the game 1–1 [51]. The Panthers regained the lead after Anton Lundell shot the puck around the boards and Skinner attempted to play the puck, but Eetu Luostarinen sent the puck to an open Vladimir Tarasenko who wristed the puck into the net [52].

In the second period, Oilers captain Connor McDavid made it 4–1, snapping a shot past Bobrovsky [63]. The Oilers then made it 5–1 when McDavid dropped a pass to defenceman Darnell Nurse, who shot it past Bobrovsky, leading to Panthers backup goaltender Anthony Stolarz entering the game [64]. The Oilers were then given a 5-on-3 power play, during which Ryan Nugent-Hopkins scored to make the score 6–1 [65]. In the third period, the Oilers continued their rout, with both Holloway and Ryan McLeod scoring to push the score to 8–1, forcing a fifth game and avoiding becoming the first team since 1998 to be swept in the Stanley Cup Finals [66]. With an assist on the Holloway goal, Connor McDavid set the single season playoff record for most assists in one playoff year, breaking the record previously held by Wayne Gretzky in 1988 [67]. 

## Game five

In game five, Connor Brown scored the initial goal for the Oilers in the first period, with his backhand shot beating goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky for a shorthanded goal.

Ten seconds later, the Panthers had a goal by Aleksander Barkov disallowed when replay showed Sam Reinhart was offside on the play [78]. Zach Hyman then made it 3–0 for Edmonton when he scored backhand on a breakaway chance [79]. The Panthers were able to get on the board in the third period when Barkov dangled the puck around goaltender Stuart Skinner [80]. The Oilers held off the Panthers for the remainder of the game, with Ryan McLeod and Darnell Nurse each scoring an empty net goal for a 5–1 victory [81].

The Panthers defended their lead into the third period, with goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky stopping the remaining nine shots to win their first Stanley Cup [85].

McDavid also joined Reggie Leach in 1976 as the only skaters to achieve this feat.
