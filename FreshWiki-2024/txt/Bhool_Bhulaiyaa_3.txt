# Plot

In 1824, a lady is seen doing kathak which comes under the notice of the king, who drags her out and burns her alive on a pyre. However, she returns as a vengeful spirit and kills both the king and the man who burned her.. 200 years later, in 2024, Ruhaan enjoys deceiving people by claiming to be a ghostbuster, "Rooh Baba". Meera's uncle, the brother-in-law of the current Maharaja of Rakhtghat, calls him to speak with Meera, who is dead now. When Meera arrives, Ruhaan is terrified, believing her to be a real ghost. In reality, Meera is alive and her uncle captures his reaction on Meera's phone and blackmails Ruhaan, threatening to post the video online if he does not accompany them to Rakhtghat. After Meera and her uncle offers him 10 millions rupees, Ruhaan agrees. Upon his arrival, everyone is shocked to see him because he looks exactly like Prince Debendranath, the prince from 1824. The royal family currently lives in the horse barn in poverty due to the presence of Manjulika's spirit in the palace, and has descended into poverty. They being the royal family take loans from their own prajah.. The Rajpurohit warns everyone not to go near Manjulika's room, advising that it should only be opened on Durgashtami by a royal family member reborn to rid them of the ghost. Believing that Ruhaan is the reincarnation of Debendranath, everyone moves back to the palace.. According to local lore, 200 years ago, Manjulika was a princess. The king also had a son, Debendranath, with a servant. When he decided to name Debendranath as his heir, Manjulika killed him out of rage. In retaliation, the king burned Manjulika alive, and her vengeful spirit now haunts the palace, responsible for several deaths.. In present time, Meera calls in a restoration team to work on the palace so it can be sold. Mallika, the team leader, begins showing signs of possession. Ruhaan learns about the real ghost and plans to escape but realizes he needs to erase his video before leaving. While searching for it, he discovers Meera has secretly taken his photos, suggesting romantic feelings for him. She confirms this when confronted.. Ruhaan decides to stay but soon learns that Pandit, Panditayaan, and Chhote Pandit have been already living in Manjulika's room. They reveal they've been trying to scare everyone away so they could stay there in peace. The restoration team takes over the room and accidentally breaks a wall, uncovering a hidden passage leading to a room sealed with the Bhairava Kavach. Curious, the Rajpurohit decides to research more about the palace's history.. Desperate to sell the property, Raja Saab decides to break the Bhairava Kavach with Rooh Baba's help. Just as they open the door, the Rajpurohit arrives with a shocking news. He reveals that 200 years ago the king actually had two daughters, Manjulika and Anjulika, who despised each other. Despite knowing the palace's haunted reputation, Mandira arrives as a prospective buyer to learn more about the estate. After she meets Mallika, strange events begin occurring. The Rajpurohit warns everyone to be cautious until Durgashtami, the day when Manjulika is expected to take her revenge.. Ruhaan and Meera have several eerie encounters with both Mallika and Mandira, confused about which one is the real Manjulika. The Rajpurohit returns with sacred oil to destroy Manjulika's spirit, and the night before Durgashtami, they gather at the site where her body was burned 200 years ago. Ruhaan cleverly manages to exorcise the spirit that had possessed both Mallika and Mandira, finally learning that it was not a female but actually a male ghost, that of Prince Debendranath, who was killed 200 years ago for his love of dance, cross-dressing, and disdain for his male identity.. It is finally revealed that Anjulika and Manjulika had together conspired to have Debendranath killed to secure the throne. Once exposed to the king, the king ordered his ministers to burn him (Debendranath) alive for the disgrace. Following this, the king, knowing daughters did it to steal the throne, exiled them both from the kingdom and announced that Manjulika will be known for killing her brother brutally to the public, and Anjulika's existence in history will be erased. Sometime later, Prince Debendranath's ghost killed the king and his guards as revenge. The Rajpurohit of that era then sealed Debendranath's spirit in the hidden room, secured by the Bhairava Kavach. He also made the same Bhairava Kavach in the door of Manjulika's room to cover up the truth about who the real ghost is. It was finally revealed that it was Debendranath's spirit that was causing all the disturbances by possessing his sisters' reincarnations, Mallika and Mandira, to trick everyone into killing them.. When Mallika and Mandira are about to destroy the captured Debendranath's spirit, they realize their guilt and apologize to Debendranath's spirit for the harm they have caused in the past, and the three of them share a heartfelt moment as Debendranath finally finds the peace he's longed for over two centuries and gets Moksh.. In the mid-credit scene, it is revealed that Mandira is not the real buyer. She reveals herself to Ruhaan that she is actually ACP Rathore IPS, an undercover cop, who has come to arrest Ruhaan for his frauds as the fake ghostbuster Rooh Baba. Ruhaan, upon knowing this, faints out of shock while everyone laughs..

During shooting, director Anees Bazmee faced significant challenges as he fractured his leg on the last day of the film recce. Against doctor's suggestions to get a steel plate and rest for 3 months, he opted for minor surgery that allowed him to honor his commitment to the film. He came to the film set in a wheelchair and continued with his work. The film's production involved extensive planning and coordination, with key members Bhushan Kumar, Bazmee, and Aaryan actively engaged in discussions and preparations [17] [18]. Filming began in Mumbai, with the first schedule wrapping up on 27 March 2024. During this schedule, the entry sequence of Aaryan was also shot [20]. A massive set was erected in Film City, Mumbai, specifically for the song, which involved over a thousand background dancers with choreography done by Ganesh Acharya. After a short break, Bazmee, still recovering from his injury, scouted for locations in Kolkata for the next schedule [21] [22].

The song 'Mere Dholna' has been filmed as jugalbandi between Madhuri and Vidya and has been choreographed by Chinni Prakash [30] [31].

## Critical response

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 43% of 14 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10. Bollywood Hungama rated the film 4.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, "Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 is a well-made horror comedy which works due to its performances, taut script, creative execution and above all, an unpredictable climax."  Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com rated the film 3/5 stars and opined "A gleefully hammy Madhuri and Vidya's volley of death stares and evil laughs engage in a ruthless glamorous tug of war in Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3" [57]. Renuka Vyavahare of The Times of India rated 3.5/5 stars and wrote "The movie is unabashedly entertaining, cheesy, and wild, with moments that will have you laughing out loud." [58] [59]. Vinamra Mathur of Firstpost rated the film 3/5 stars and wrote "Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 could be savored taste; for those wanting to see romance have Aaryan and Dimri, for those waiting to see the OG Manjulika have Balan at their service, for anyone enamored by Dixit, she brings back the memories of Devdas with her thunderous aura and nimble moves. And for those stepping in with zero expectations, may not be exactly doing a Bhool!". Anuj Kumar of The Hindu says Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 is a drab horror comedy where talented actors like Madhuri Dixit and Vidya Balan have been underutilized [60]. He further says "Kartik Aaryan is the lifeline who keeps the film alive with his situational humour but director Anees Bazmee has faltered between sticking to stereotypes and taking a progressive step." He continues that stereotyping of Bengalis and their culture has been done for easy laughs but the film is ultimately a hypocritical charade. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 1.5/5 stars and wrote "Kartik Aaryan's Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 suffers from the same things that Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 did: stereotypes instead of characters, forced humour which refuses to land, and tasteless lines bordering on the risible."  Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and said "Kartik Aaryan's star turn is a repeat act that promises a box-office outcome that could be on par with what Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 yielded."  Udita Jhunjhunwala of Mint opined "The dynamic between Madhuri Dixit and Vidya Balan is an opportunity wasted in the long film, which is high on concept but low on mood" [62] [63]. Abhimanyu Mathur of Hindustan Times writes "A brave climax attempts to elevate this otherwise middling horror comedy [64]. The film simply tries to sell a brand through nostalgia, using a new(er) rendition of Ami Je Tomar and Vidya Balan." [65]. Neha Sen of Deccan Herald rated the film 3 stars out of 5 and highlighted "The film retains some traditional horror elements while still trying to be comedic. It ends up delivering neither with much grace nor gusto. A few jumpscares scattered around and a handful of laughs are not enough to salvage the broken Bangla and thoroughly under-researched presentation of the Bengali culture and festivities."  Nishad Thaivalappil of News18 rated 2/5 stars and opined "The film features unexplained flashbacks and the mediocre jokes and predictable jump scares make it a rather dull watch."  Tanmayi Savadi of Times Now rated the film 4 out of 5 stars and wrote "The film resorts to cliché jokes and dramatics [66] [67]. The scares are effective but never bone-chilling. It is enigmatic, mysterious and deceptive." [68]. Ritika Handoo of Zee News rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and highlighted "What deserves a special mention here is the twist-filled climax. The writers have done their homework well to keep the crescendo high for the end."  Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in writes "Imagination is largely in short supply in the threequel [69]. Except for a twist about Manjulika's identity that works well, the film has little that we haven't seen before in the previous movie."  Amit Bhatia of ABP Live rated the film 3/5 stars and said "Vidya Balan and Madhuri Dixit breathe energy into the narrative, and while the comedy isn't as punchy as hoped, the story's twists and moral message manage to engage [70]. With a blend of humour, nostalgia, and spooky twists, it's an entertaining ride that ultimately delivers a memorable experience." [71]. Aakriti Agarwala of The Statesman rated the film 2.5 stars and wrote, "Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 is a through-and-through climax-driven film that didn't know what to do with the first two hours. Dominated by dull comic punches and references, unnecessary and forced song sequences, and complete mutilation of the Bengali language and dialect, the film fails to keep the audiences at the edge of their seats. It was only in the last 30 minutes that the stars had the chance to shine." [72].
