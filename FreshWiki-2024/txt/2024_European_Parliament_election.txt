2024_European_Parliament_election

The 2024 European Parliament election was held in the European Union (EU) between 6 and 9 June 2024. It was the tenth parliamentary election since the first direct elections in 1979, and the first European Parliament election after Brexit. A total of 720 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were elected to represent more than 450 million people from 27 member states. This election also coincided with a number of other elections in some European Union member states.
The European People's Party led by Ursula von der Leyen won the most seats in the European Parliament. The pro-EU centrist, liberal, social democrat and environmentalist parties suffered losses, while anti-EU right-wing populist parties made gains. The right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists group overtook the centrist Renew Europe group to win the fourth most seats, while another right-wing group, Patriots for Europe, the successor of Identity and Democracy, won the third most seats. In addition, a far-right group, Europe of Sovereign Nations, was formed, becoming the smallest group in the Parliament. In total, 187 MEPS (25% of Parliament) belonged to the hard-right which is more members than ever before in history.
On 18 July 2024, Ursula von der Leyen was re-elected President of the European Commission in a secret ballot by the European Parliament.

# Background

In the previous election, held on 23–26 May 2019, in terms of the political Groups in the Parliament, they resulted in the EPP Group and S&D suffering significant losses, while the liberal/centrist (Renew), the Greens/EFA and ID made substantial gains, with ECR and The Left had small reduction. The European People's Party, led by Manfred Weber, won the most seats in the European Parliament, but was then unable to secure support from other parties for Weber as candidate for President of the Commission. After initial deadlock, the European Council decided to nominate Ursula von der Leyen as a compromise candidate to be the new Commission President, and the European Parliament elected von der Leyen with 383 votes (374 votes needed). The commission as a whole was then approved by the European Parliament on 27 November 2019, receiving 461 votes.. The 2019 election saw an increase in the turnout, when 50.7% of eligible voters had cast a vote compared with 42.5% of the 2014 election. This was the first time that turnout had increased since the first European Parliament election in 1979. In 2024, the Eurobarometer data shows that 71% of Europeans say they are likely to vote in June, 10% higher than those who said they would in 2019 [9]. Since the last European-wide election, the right has continued to rise across Europe, remaining however split, mainly by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Russian relations issue. In 2024, before the European elections, right-wing populist parties hold or share political power in Hungary (Fidesz), Italy (Brothers of Italy), Sweden (Sweden Democrats), Finland (Finns Party), Slovakia (Slovak National Party) and Croatia (Homeland Movement) [11]. The centre-right EPP has "raised eyebrows" among some commentators for its efforts to charm parties in the ECR to create a broad conservative block,  which could upset the long-standing status-quo that has seen the EPP share power with the centre-left S&D and the centrist Renew Group [11] [12]. 

## Qatargate

The Qatargate corruption scandal, which began in December 2022, had destabilized the European Parliament following the arrest of several MEPs including Marc Tarabella; Andrea Cozzolino and Eva Kaili who was stripped of her vice presidency. Other suspects in the case include Francesco Giorgi, the parliamentary assistant of MEP Andrea Cozzolino, Pier Antonio Panzeri, founder of the Fight Impunity NGO; Niccolo Figa-Talamanca, head of the No Peace Without Justice NGO; and Luca Visentini, head of the International Trade Union Confederation. Following the scandal, the European Parliament revised its rules of procedure and its code of conduct in September 2023 [14] [15] [16]. 

## Hungary

The European Parliament views Hungary as a "hybrid regime of electoral autocracy" since 2022 and considers Hungary according to Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union in clear risk of a serious breach of the Treaty on European Union. In January 2024, a majority of European Parliament MEPs voted for a resolution demanding that the EU Council considers that Hungary be stripped of its EU voting rights under Article 7 of the Treaty [17] [18]. 

# Date of the election

The dates chosen for the elections conflicted with a long weekend in Portugal, where Portugal Day, a national holiday, was celebrated on 10 June, which was expected to suppress turnout. Despite an attempt by Portuguese leaders to find a compromise, no change was made to the default date of 6–9 June,  which required unanimity to be changed. [20] [21]. 

# Electoral system

Elections to the European Parliament are regulated by the Treaty on European Union, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and the Act concerning the election of the members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage (the Electoral Act). The Electoral Act states that the electoral procedure is governed by the national provisions in each member state, subject to the provisions of the act. Elections are conducted by direct universal suffrage by proportional representation using either a list system or single transferable vote [22]. The national electoral threshold may not exceed 5% of votes cast [22]. 

## Attempts at electoral reform

In June 2018, the Council agreed to change the EU electoral law and to reform old laws from the 1976 Electoral Act as amended in 2002. New provisions included a mandatory 2% threshold for countries with more than 35 seats and rules to prevent voters from voting in multiple countries [23]. After the Act was adopted by the Council following consent given by the European Parliament in July 2018, not all member states ratified the Act prior to the 2019 elections, which took place under the old rules [24]. As of 2023, the reform has yet to be ratified by Cyprus and Spain;  Germany only ratified in summer 2023 [25]. On 3 May 2022, the European Parliament voted to propose a new electoral law, which would contain provisions for electing 28 seats on transnational lists. As of 2024, this reform has not been approved by the Council, which must approve it unanimously,  meaning the election will be conducted under the 1976 Electoral Act as amended in 2002. [27] [28]. 

## Apportionment

As a result of Brexit, 27 seats from the British delegation were distributed to other countries in January 2020 (those elected in 2019, but not yet seated took their seats). The other 46 seats were abolished with the total number of MEPs decreasing from 751 to 705 [29]. A report in the European Parliament proposed in February 2023 to modify the apportionment in the European Parliament and increase the number of MEPs from 705 to 716 in order to adapt to the development of the population and preserve degressive proportionality. It was passed in the plenary in June 2023 [31] [32]. On 26 July 2023, the Council reached a preliminary agreement, which would increase the size of the European Parliament to 720 seats [32]. On 13 September 2023, the European Parliament consented to this decision,  which was adopted by the European Council on 22 September 2023 [33] [34]. 

# Lead candidates

## Spitzenkandidat system

In the run-up to the 2014 European Parliament elections a new informal system was unveiled for the selection of the European Commission President (known colloquially as the Spitzenkandidat system) dictating that whichever party group gained the most seats (or the one able to secure the support of a majority coalition) would see their candidate become President of the Commission. In 2014, the candidate of the largest group, Jean-Claude Juncker, was eventually nominated and elected as Commission President [74]. European party leaders aimed to reintroduce the system in 2019, with them selecting lead candidates and organizing a televised debate between those candidates [75]. In the aftermath of the election German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen was chosen as Commission President, even though she had not been a candidate prior to the election, while Manfred Weber, lead candidate for the EPP, which had gained the most seats, was not nominated as he was unable to secure support from any other party [76]. Following this appointment of a Commission President who had not been a Spitzenkandidat, some called for the system to be abandoned, while others called for it to be revived in the 2024 elections [77]. In 2023, multiple political parties at the European level announced their intentions to nominate a main candidate. ECR   and ID have rejected doing so [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86]. 

## European People's Party

On 18 June 2024, Hungary's Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) officially left the European People's Party, in response to the group's decision to admit the Tisza Party (TISZA), also from Hungary, in their ranks. Elected MEPs from the Netherlands' Farmer–Citizen Movement (BBB) and New Social Contract (NSC), Czech Republic's Mayors and Independents (STAN), Denmark's Liberal Alliance (LA) and Germany's Family Party also submitted requests to join the EPP Group [204] [206]. 

## Party of European Socialists

The centre-left PES held its congress in Rome on 2 March. Nominees required the backing of nine PES full member parties or organisations, with nominations closing on 17 January. On 18 January, the PES announced that the Luxembourgish European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights Nicolas Schmit was the sole nominee to meet the nominating requirements. He was then nominated on 2 March during the party congress, along with the adoption of the election programme [97]. 

## Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party

The ALDE party held its extraordinary congress in Brussels on 20–21 March 2024. On 7 March 2024, following months of speculation, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas announced that she had rejected the offer from ALDE to be the party's Spitzenkandidat [99]. Luxembourg's former Prime Minister Xavier Bettel announced that he is not interested in the post either [100]. On 11 March, the German FDP nominated Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann to become presidential candidate. She was then elected on March 20 during the party congress, along with the adoption of the election programme [102]. 

## European Democratic Party

During the 8 March 2024 Convention in Florence, the European Democratic Party nominated Sandro Gozi as its lead candidate and approved its election programme. 

## European Green Party

During the 2–4 February 2024 congress in Lyon, the European Green Party elected Terry Reintke and Bas Eickhout as its two presidential candidates and adopted its election programme. Nominees were Bas Eickhout, Elīna Pinto, Terry Reintke, Benedetta Scuderi [106] [107] [108]. 

## European Free Alliance

In October 2023, the congress of the European Free Alliance elected Maylis Roßberg and Raül Romeva as its presidential candidates, and adopted its election programme. 

## Party of the European Left

During the 24–25 February 2024 congress in Ljubljana,  the PEL elected Walter Baier as its presidential candidate and adopted its election programme [113]. 

## European Christian Political Movement

In a meeting held on 24 February 2024, the European Christian Political Movement appointed party president Valeriu Ghilețchi as its lead candidate for the European Commission. 

## European Pirate Party

At its General Assembly in Luxembourg in January 2024, the European Pirate Party nominated Marcel Kolaja and Anja Hirschel as lead candidates. 

## Volt Europa

On 27 November 2023, Volt Europa adopted its European election programme at its General Assembly in Paris. During the 6–7 April 2024 campaign launch event in Brussels the party elected German MEP Damian Boeselager and Dutch MEP Sophie in 't Veld as its lead candidates [117]. Regarding which European Parliament group to join after the elections, Boeselager said he was “open to discussions” between remaining in Greens/EFA or joining Renew Europe in due course [118]. To emphasise its demand for transnational lists, Volt Europa also presented a symbolic transnational list for the election alongside its leading candidates [119]. 

# Issues

## Immigration

Immigration was cited by Politico as a key issue in elections in several countries, including Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland and Sweden. 

## Potential enlargement

Various sources wrote that an increased influence of right-wing and far-right parties in the European Parliament could  derail Ukrainian accession, as polling showed low support for EU enlargement in countries where such parties have power. Exceptions were Poland's Law and Justice supporting Ukrainian accession, and Hungary's Fidesz – a party highly sceptical of Ukraine – being in favour of bids from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, two countries with governments favourable to Russia [122] [123]. 

# Campaign

## The future of Ursula von der Leyen

Ursula von der Leyen, the current European Commission President, did not formally announce her intention to stand for a second term until February 2024. This led to speculation about other potential EPP candidates, such as President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola. However, on 19 February 2024, von der Leyen announced her intention to seek a second term. and on 7 March she was elected European People's Party presidential candidate with 400 votes in favour, 89 against and 10 blank, out of the 737 EPP congressional delegates [92]. In Germany, the coalition government had also agreed to support the spitzenkandidat system,  implicitly accepting the prospect of von der Leyen, who within Germany hails from the opposition CDU party, becoming Commission President again, depending on the election results [124]. Otherwise, the German government coalition agreement grants the right to nominate the next German EU Commissioner to the Greens, provided the Commission President is not from Germany. 

## The future of Charles Michel

In January 2024, Charles Michel announced he would step down early as president of the European Council to run for the European Parliament instead. This would have meant that European Union leaders would potentially discuss his successor in the summer  as, if elected to the European Parliament, he would have had to step down because of prohibition of the dual mandate [126] [127]. His mandate had been to set to expire in November 2024 [128]. For this unanticipated decision Michel was criticised by EU officials and diplomats [129]. He was criticised by his political ally Sophie in 't Veld who questioned his "credibility" [130]. This timing was further criticised for potential disruptions it could cause, as Article 2(4) of the European Council's Rules of Procedure provide that, if its President leaves office early, he "shall be replaced, where necessary until the election of his or her successor, by the member of the European Council representing the Member State holding the six-monthly Presidency of the Council" [131]. This would have been the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose country would be scheduled to take over the rotating presidency of the European Council on 1 July [132]. On 26 January 2024, Michel withdrew his candidacy and thus delayed his departure [133]. 

## Russian influence scandal

On 27 March, the Czech Republic sanctioned the news site Voice of Europe, claiming that the site is part of a network for pro-Russian influence. The following day, Belgian Prime Minister De Croo, referring to the sanctions during a debate in the Belgian parliament, said that Russia had targeted MEPs, but also paid them [135]. On 2 April, the Czech news portal Denik N reported, citing several ministers, that there are audio recordings of the German far-right politician Petr Bystron (MP, AfD) that incriminate him of having accepted money [136]. On 12 April, it became known that the Belgian public prosecutor's office is investigating whether European politicians were paid to spread Russian propaganda [137]. In addition to Bystron, the investigation is also targeting Dutch MEP Marcel de Graaff (FvD) and German MEP Maximilian Krah (AfD). Ukrainian politician and businessman Viktor Medvedchuk, who is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is believed to be the man behind Voice of Europe. 

## Future European Parliament groups

Ahead of the 2024 European Parliament election, National Rally spokespeople Jordan Bardella and Caroline Parmentier announced they would part ways with Alternative for Germany after the election and not include the AfD in the ID group due to controversial statements on Nazi Germany made by AfD lead candidate Maximilian Krah in an interview and allegations of Chinese espionage influence on the party. Italy's Lega and the Czech SPD backed the position taken by the National Rally,   but Vlaams Belang declined to support expulsion of the AfD from the ID group or rule out further cooperation with the AfD, while criticising Krah's remarks [139] [140] [141] [142]. The Danish People's Party conditioned future cooperation with the AfD on Krah's exclusion from the ID group [145]. The AfD was expelled from the group on 23 May [144]. After the European elections, there are often changes or creation of new political groups by the national parties in the European Parliament. This concerns both the new parties that have not yet announced which group they will be part of, and the parties already present in the European Parliament who choose to change group at the beginning of a new legislature [146]. According to the Parliament's rules of procedure, a political group requires at least 23 MEPs from at least one-quarter of the Member States (7 out of 27), and a political declaration, setting out the purpose of the group [146]. Several news outlets have speculated on the possibility of a new group guided by the German Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht party, created in January 2024. This 'left-conservative' and eurosceptic group could also include La France Insoumise, the Five Star Movement, ANO 2011, Course of Freedom, Direction – Social Democracy, Voice – Social Democracy, the Lithuanian Regions Party, For Stability!, and Together for Catalonia [148] [149] [150]. In April 2024, Euractiv reported that BSW announced it had the necessary figures to establish the new group [146] [149]. After the expulsion of the AfD from ID, it is uncertain where its MEPs will be part of a group after the election. On 30 May, RTL Hungary reported that MHM and AfD were considering forming a new group. This 'far-right' and eurosceptic group could include also Niki and Republic Movement [152]. After Revival was expelled from ID party, the party organized the 'Sofia Declaration' with the Republic Movement, Forum for Democracy, Our Homeland Movement, Alternative for Sweden and the Agricultural Livestock Party of Greece on 12 April 2024 [146].

### European People's Party

On 18 June 2024, Hungary's Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) officially left the European People's Party, in response to the group's decision to admit the Tisza Party (TISZA), also from Hungary, in their ranks. Elected MEPs from the Netherlands' Farmer–Citizen Movement (BBB) and New Social Contract (NSC), Czech Republic's Mayors and Independents (STAN), Denmark's Liberal Alliance (LA) and Germany's Family Party also submitted requests to join the EPP Group [204] [206]. 

### European Conservatives and Reformists

On 19 June 2024, the European Conservatives and Reformists group announced in an official press release that elected MEPs from Romania's Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), as well as former members of France's Reconquête (including Marion Maréchal), had joined the group. As a result, the ECR became the third-largest faction in the European Parliament, overtaking Renew Europe in the process. However, on 5 July, Spain's Vox announced their intention to leave the ECR, in order to join the new Patriots for Europe alliance;   as a result, the group's membership dropped to 78 MEPs, just one ahead of Renew [210] [211]. 

### Greens/EFA

In June 2024, it was reported that five elected MEPs from Volt Europa, two of whom from the Netherlands and three from Germany,  had begun negotiations both with Renew Europe and the Greens/EFA to join their respective ranks on a stable basis [213]. On June 20, the Volt MEPs released a joint press statement recommending to join Greens/EFA, which they perceived as closer to their stance against right-wing populism, while expressing concerns over the presence of parties such as Czech Republic's ANO 2011 and the Netherlands' People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) – which had agreed to join a coalition with the right-wing populist Party for Freedom (PVV) to form the Schoof cabinet – in the ranks of Renew [214]. On June 24, Volt officially announced that 87% of the party's members had voted in favour of joining the Greens/EFA group [213] [214]. 

### Renew Europe

On 21 June 2024, Czech Republic's ANO 2011 announced their decision to unilaterally withdraw from the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, as well as Renew Europe, due to "different positions" on the European Green Deal and the EU's migration policy. On 2 July, Irish MEP Michael McNamara, who had been elected as an independent candidate, officially became a member of Renew. 

### The Left

On 3 July 2024, the co-spokesperson of The Left, Manon Aubry, announced that Italy's Five Star Movement (M5S), who were previously part of Non-Inscrits and failed to create a new group with Germany's BSW after the election,  had submitted an official request to join the group, who had already admitted the MEPs from Italian Left following the election [220]. Despite initial concerns, mainly related to the M5S's past alliances with the UK Independence Party in the Eighth European Parliament, and Lega during the First Conte government,  the group officially admitted the party on 4 July [221]. In the process, the M5S became the second most-represented party within the GUE/NGL group, behind only France's La France Insoumise [223]. The agreement included an initial six-month spell of "reciprocal discussion" involving the political views expressed both by The Left and the M5S; Italian fact-checking portal Pagella Politica noted that their respective electoral programs diverged more or less evidently on several prominent topics, including open support of anti-fascist values, the EU's relations with the NATO, immigration and commercial policies, as well as the goals set by the European Green Deal. 

### Identity and Democracy

Following the announcement of the new Patriots for Europe alliance, Identity and Democracy saw several member parties leave the formation, or express interest in doing so,   with examples including Portugal's Chega,  France's National Rally  and Italy's Lega [273]. Following the departure of MEPs from several key member parties, the ID group could no longer form a political group in the EU Parliament, which has a minimum requirement of members from at least seven member nations [229]. According to anonymous ID members, the whole group could eventually get merged into Patriots for Europe, as part of negotiations supervised by the leader of the National Rally, Marine Le Pen. On 8 July 2024, the group officially disbanded, following the establishment of the PfE group in the European Parliament [230] [231]. 

### Patriots for Europe

On 30 June 2024, the Prime Minister of Hungary and leader of the Fidesz party, Viktor Orbán, publicly announced his intention to form a new parliamentary group, named Patriots for Europe, together with Austria's Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) and Czech Republic's ANO 2011;   the alliance needed support from parties from at least four other EU countries in order to be recognized as an official group in the European Parliament [233] [234]. As a result, the FPÖ would complete a switch from the Identity and Democracy group;   on the other hand, ANO 2011 had left Renew Europe a week before the announcement, while MEPs from Fidesz were part of Non-Inscrits since 2021, when the party had left the European People's Party [229] [233] [233] [234]. Portugal's Chega officially entered the alliance on 2 July,   while Italy's Lega also publicly expressed interest in joining the new group [235]. On 5 July, Spain's Vox announced their intention to enter Patriots for Europe, after leaving the ECR group,   with Netherlands' Party for Freedom, previously in the ID group, following suit [229] [236] [210] [211]. The following day, both Denmark's Danish People's Party (DF)  and Belgium's Vlaams Belang switched from ID to the new group;   as a result, Patriots for Europe met the EU Parliament's minimum threshold for formal recognition [237] [238] [236] [239]. An MEP from the DF party, Anders Vistisen, stated that they agreed to join the alliance upon the condition that each national member would be allowed to pursue their own foreign policy, including on matters such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine [236]. On 7 July, the President of France's National Rally (RN), Jordan Bardella, confirmed the party's intention to switch from ID to Patriots for Europe;   as a result, the RN became the biggest delegation within the alliance, having elected 30 MEPs [231] [240]. The following day, the group was officially established in the European Parliament: aside of the aforementioned parties, Italy's Lega, Czech Republic's Přísaha, Greece's Voice of Reason and Latvia's Latvia First also joined Patriots of Europe, bringing the group to a total amount of 84 MEPs, and making it the third-largest formation in the hemicycle [231]. Bardella was appointed as the president of Patriots for Europe, while Vistisen was nominated as their chief whip [232] [241]. On 10 July, It was reported that the MEPs from a branch of Poland's Confederation, National Movement, had expressed an interest in joining the PfE group, which was neither confirmed nor denied by Patriots. If the party were to join, it would confirm a split within Confederation's other factions in the EU, New Hope and Confederation of the Polish Crown. 

### Europe of Sovereign Nations

In June 2024, it was reported that Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which had been expelled from Identity and Democracy before the election, was holding talks with other far-right parties for the creation of a new parliamentary group, tentatively named "The Sovereignists". According to reports, the group could also include Poland's Confederation, Bulgaria's Revival, Spain's Se Acabó La Fiesta (SALF), Romania's S.O.S. Romania, Slovakia's Republic Movement (Republika), France's Reconquête, Hungary's Our Homeland Movement, Greece's Niki and Czech Republic's Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD). On 10 July, it was reported that a new parliamentary group, named Europe of Sovereign Nations (ESN), had officially formed, having met the minimum requirements to get formal recognition within the European Parliament. The group was officially launched later the same day; MEPs from Germany's AfD (the largest party in the group), Poland's Confederation, Bulgaria's Revival, France's Reconquête (excluding the former members who had left the party to join the ECR), Czech Republic's SPD, Hungary's Our Homeland Movement, Slovakia's Republika and Lithuania's People and Justice Union, all joined ESN, bringing the group to a total amount of 25 MEPs. René Aust (AfD) and Stanisław Tyszka (NN) were elected co-chairpersons of the parliamentary group [245] [246]. Members from Spain's SALF and Greece's Niki were initially expected to also join ESN, but withdrew at the last minute. A few members from AfD and Republika did not join the group, as well,  while MEPs from a single branch of Poland's Confederation, New Hope, did enter the group, confirming a split within the alliance's other parties in the EU Parliament, National Movement (which was reportedly in talks to join the PfE group) and Confederation of the Polish Crown, whose lone-MEP, Grzegorz Braun, was set to sit with the Non-Inscrits [245] [246]. Three MEPs, Maximilian Krah (from Germany's AfD), Braun and Milan Mazurek (from Slovakia's Republika) were all reportedly excluded from joining the group, due to the anti-semitic and Holocaust-denying nature of their previous public statements. The co-leader of AfD, Alice Weidel, commented and said that "no anti-semites should have a place in a potential group with  [her] party."  Despite previous speculations, Romania's S.O.S [246]. Romania was also excluded from ESN, due to some of the involved delegations expressing concerns about the party's declared goal to "redesign Eastern Europe's map" to establish the so-called "Greater Romania", a hypothetical Nation-state roughly resembling the Kingdom of Romania in the interwar period. 

## Commission formation

To be elected Commission President, a candidate must be proposed by the European Council with a reinforced qualified majority (at least 72% of the states representing at least 65% of the population) and receive a majority of the votes of the members of the European Parliament (at least 361 out of 720). On 27 June, during the European Council meeting, national leaders proposed Ursula von der Leyen (EPP) as candidate for President of the European Commission, considered Kaja Kallas (ALDE) to be the appropriate candidate for High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and elected António Costa (PES) as President of the European Council. On 18 July 2024, Ursula von der Leyen was re-elected president of the European Commission in a secret ballot, with 401 votes in favour, 284 against, and 22 cast blank or invalid votes.
