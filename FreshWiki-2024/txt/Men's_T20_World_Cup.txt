Men's_T20_World_Cup

The ICC Men's T20 World Cup, formerly the ICC World Twenty20, is a biennial T20I cricket tournament, organised by the International Cricket Council. It was held in every odd year from 2007 to 2009, and since 2010 it has been held in every even year with the exception of 2018 and 2020. This event was rebranded from ICC World Twenty20 to ICC Men's T20 World Cup in November 2018.
The 2011 edition of the tournament was brought forward to 2010 to replace the ICC Champions Trophy. This scheduling bottleneck was caused after the 5th edition of the ICC Champions Trophy, scheduled to be hosted by Pakistan in 2008, was delayed and shifted to South Africa in 2009 due to security concerns. The Champions Trophy was converted into a quadrennial tournament after that. In May 2016, the ICC put forward the idea of having a tournament in 2018, with South Africa being the possible host, but later dropped the idea as the top member nations were busied with multiple bilateral cricket events taking place in 2018.
The 2020 edition of the tournament was scheduled to take place in Australia but due to the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe, the tournament was postponed until 2021, with the intended host changed to India. The 2021 Men's T20 World Cup was later relocated to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman due to problems relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in India, taking place five years after the previous (2016) iteration. The capacity in stadiums was reduced to 70% of the maximum.
As of 2024, nine editions have so far been played and a total of 24 teams have competed. Six national teams have won the T20 World Cup so far. Three teams, West Indies (2012, 2016), England (2010, 2022) and India (2007, 2024), have won the competition twice each. Pakistan (2009), Sri Lanka (2014), and Australia (2021) have one title each. A total of 15 countries have hosted the tournament (including 6 island nations of the West Indies). India are the current champions having won their second title in the 2024 edition. The next edition of the tournament will take place in India and Sri Lanka in 2026.

# History

## Background

When the Benson & Hedges Cup ended in 2002, the ECB sought another one-day competition to appeal to the younger generation in response to dwindling crowds and reduced sponsorship. The Board wanted to deliver fast-paced, exciting cricket accessible to fans who were put off by the longer versions of the game. Stuart Robertson, the marketing manager of the ECB, proposed a 20-over per innings game to county chairmen in 2001, and they voted 11–7 in favour of adopting the new format [1]. 

### Domestic tournaments

The first official Twenty20 matches were played on 13 June 2003 between the English counties in the T20 Blast. The first season of Twenty20 in England was a relative success, with the Surrey Lions defeating the Warwickshire Bears by 9 wickets in the final to claim the title [3]. The first Twenty20 match held at Lord's, on 15 July 2004 between Middlesex and Surrey, attracted a crowd of 27,509, the largest attendance for any county cricket game at the ground – other than a one-day final – since 1983 [4]. Soon after, with the adoption of Twenty20 matches by other cricket boards, the popularity of the format grew with unexpected crowd attendance, new domestic tournaments such as Pakistan's National T20 Cup and the Stanford 20/20 tournament, and the financial incentive in the format [5]. 

### Twenty20 Internationals

On 17 February 2005 Australia defeated New Zealand in the first men's full international Twenty20 match, played at Eden Park in Auckland. The game was played in a light-hearted manner – both sides turned out in kit similar to that worn in the 1980s, the New Zealand team's a direct copy of that worn by the Beige Brigade. Some of the players also sported moustaches/beards and hair-styles popular in the 1980s, taking part in a competition amongst themselves for "best retro look", at the request of the Beige Brigade. Australia won the game comprehensively, and as the result became obvious towards the end of the NZ innings, the players and umpires took things less seriously – Glenn McGrath jokingly replayed the Trevor Chappell underarm incident from a 1981 ODI between the two sides, and Billy Bowden showed him a mock penalty card (red cards are not normally used in cricket) in response. 

## Inaugural edition

It was first decided that an ICC World Twenty20 would take place every two years, except in the event of a Cricket World Cup being scheduled in the same year, in which case it would be held the year before. The first tournament was in 2007 in South Africa where India defeated Pakistan in the final [70]. Kenya and Scotland had to qualify via the 2007 WCL Division One which was a 50-over competition that took place in Nairobi [10]. In December 2007 it was decided to hold a qualifying tournament with a 20-over format to better prepare the teams [11]. With six participants, two would qualify for the 2009 tournament and would each receive $250,000 in prize money. The second tournament was won by Pakistan who beat Sri Lanka by 8 wickets in England on 21 June 2009 [12]. The 2010 World Twenty20 tournament, which was brought forward from 2011 to replace the ICC Champions Trophy, was held in the West Indies in May 2010, where England defeated Australia by 7 wickets in the final [13]. The 2012 World Twenty20 was won by the West Indies, by defeating Sri Lanka in the final [14] [15]. 

## Expansion to 16 teams (2014)

The 2012 edition was to be expanded into a 16-team format, however this was reverted to 12. The 2014 tournament, held in Bangladesh, was the first to feature 16 teams including all ten full members and six associate members who qualified through the 2013 World Twenty20 Qualifier [17]. The top eight full member teams in the Men's T20I Team rankings on 8 October 2012 were given a place in the Super 10 stage. The remaining eight teams competed in the group stage, from which two teams advanced to the Super 10 stage. In May 2016, the ICC proposed a World Twenty20 tournament in 2018, with South Africa being the possible host,  but this was later dropped as the top member nations were busied with multiple bilateral cricket events taking place in 2018 [18] [19] [20]. 

## Rebranding (2018) and COVID-19 (2020)

As part of a goal to heighten the profile of the World Twenty20 tournaments, the ICC announced in 2018 that they would be rebranded as the "T20 World Cup" beginning in 2020—when Australia was to host both the men's and women's tournaments in the same year. In July 2020, the ICC announced that the 2020 tournament had been postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and with Australian international travel restrictions not expected to be lifted until 2021,  the ICC chose to relocate the tournament to India, and award Australia the 2022 edition as compensation [23] [24] [25]. Due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic in India, the tournament was played at venues in the United Arab Emirates and Oman instead, although India (via Board of Control for Cricket in India) still remained the formal host. 

## Expansion to 20 teams (2024)

In June 2021, the ICC announced that the Men's T20 World Cup would expand to 20 teams beginning in 2024, divided into four groups of five each for the group stage. The top two teams in each pool would advance to the Super 8 stage. The 2024 T20 World Cup was hosted by the West Indies and the United States [28] [29]. It was the first time the U.S. has hosted a major ICC event; the three U.S. venues included one existing stadium (Central Broward Park), a stadium that had been repurposed for cricket in 2023 (Grand Prairie Stadium), and the temporary Nassau County International Cricket Stadium. In December 2024, following an agreement between BCCI and PCB, the ICC confirmed that India and Pakistan matches at ICC events hosted by India or Pakistan would be played at a neutral venue until 2027. Thus, any matches involving Pakistan at the 2026 tournament which is to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka will be played at Sri Lanka. The 2028 edition will be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, and the 2030 tournament by England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland following [33]. 

# Hosts

The International Cricket Council's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining bids from the nations which have expressed an interest in holding the event. After South Africa in 2007,  the tournament was hosted by England, the West Indies, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016 respectively [35]. After a gap of five years, India won the hosting rights of the 2021 edition as well, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic the matches were played in the United Arab Emirates and Oman [36]. The 2022 edition was hosted by Australia, who won the tournament in the previous year [37] [38]. In December 2015, Tim Anderson, the ICC's head of global development, suggested that a future tournament be hosted by the United States. He believed that hosting the event could help spur growth of the game in the country, where it is relatively obscure and faces competition by other sports such as baseball. In 2020, the United States and West Indies expressed interest in co-hosting a T20 World Cup after 2023,  with Malaysia being another possible contender [40] [41]. In November 2021 as part of the 2024–2031 men's hosts cycle, the ICC confirmed the hosts for the next four Men's T20 World Cup tournaments from 2024 to 2030 [42]. The West Indies and United States would co-host the 2024 edition, India and Sri Lanka to co-host the 2026 edition, Australia and New Zealand to host the 2028 edition and the 2030 edition is to be co-hosted by England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland [43]. 

# Format

## Qualification

All ICC full members qualify automatically for the tournament, with the remaining places filled by other ICC members through a qualification process. Qualification for the inaugural 2007 World Twenty20 came from the results of the first cycle of the World Cricket League, a 50-over league for ICC associate and affiliate members [47]. The two finalists of the 2007 WCL Division One tournament, Kenya and Scotland, qualified for the World Twenty20 later in the year. A separate qualification tournament was implemented for the 2009 World Twenty20 and was retained until 2022 [48]. The number of teams qualifying through the World Twenty20 Qualifier varied, two in 2009,  2010  and 2012,  six in 2014,  2016  and 2021,  and 4 in 2022 (A, B) [50] [50] [51] [52] [79] [54]. Until 2016, teams advanced to the T20 World Cup Qualifier through the WCL [55]. After the WCL was superseded by the new CWC qualification process, a new set of regional qualifiers were introduced in 2019. Until the 2022 edition, teams from regional qualifiers advanced to the T20WC Qualifier through which they qualified for the T20 World Cup [56]. Following the tournament's expansion to include 20 teams, winners of regional qualifiers would directly advance to the T20 World Cup based on the regional quota. 

## Tournament

The T20 World Cup is played in three stages. The preliminary stage or group stage is played by 2 (2014–2022) or 4 (2007–2012; 2024–present) groups in a round-robin format. The second round known as Super 8 (2007–2012; 2024–present), Super 10 (2014–2016) and Super 12 (2021–2022) is also played by 2 groups in a round-robin format. In both the preliminary round and the Super round, teams are ranked based on: 1) Points; 2) Wins; 3) Net run rate; 4) Results of games between tied teams. The third round is played as a knockout stage of four teams [59]. In case of a tie (that is, both teams scoring the same number of runs at the end of their respective innings), a Super Over would decide the winner [60] [61]. In the case of a tie occurring again in the Super Over, subsequent super overs would be played until there is a winner. Prior to 2019, the match would be won by the team that had scored the most boundaries in their innings. During the 2007 tournament, a bowl-out was used to decide the loser of tied matches [62]. 

# Trophy

The ICC Men's T20 World Cup Trophy is presented to the winners of the final. It is made of silver and rhodium and weighs approximately 12 kg (26 lb) and stands 57.15 cm (22.50 in) tall, with a width of 16.5 cm (6.5 in) at the top and 13.97 cm (5.50 in) at the base. It was designed in 2007 by Minale Bryce Design Strategy, based in Queensland, Australia [64]. The trophy was initially manufactured by Amit Pabuwal in India,  and then in 2012, Links of London became the manufacturer of the trophy [64] [64]. In 2021, Thomas Lyte became the official manufacturer of the trophy [65] [66]. 

# Summary
