The 2024 World Open (officially the 2024 Huading Nylon World Open) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 18 to 24 March 2024 at the Yushan Sport Centre in Yushan, China. The fifth edition of the World Open held in Yushan since 2016, it marked the return of the event to the tour after a three‑season hiatus due to the COVID‑19 pandemic.

It was also the fourth and last major tournament of the season to be held in China, following the International Championship. Organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by Huading Nylon, the event was broadcast by CCTV-5, Migu, and Huya domestically, and by other broadcasters worldwide. The winner received £170,000 from a total prize fund of £815,000.
Judd Trump won the previous edition, having defeated Thepchaiya Un-Nooh 10‍–‍5 in the final of the 2019 event. He successfully defended the title, beating Ding Junhui 10‍–‍4 in the final, and claimed his 28th career ranking title to equal the number won by Steve Davis. It was Trump's fifth ranking title of the season, following his wins at the 2023 English Open, the 2023 Wuhan Open, the 2023 Northern Ireland Open, and the 2024 German Masters. It was also the third time Trump had won five or more ranking titles in a single season, having done so in the 2019‍–‍20 and the 2020‍–‍21 seasons. The only other players that have achieved the feat were Stephen Hendry in 1990‍–‍94, Ding in 2013‍–‍14, Mark Selby in 2016‍–‍17, and Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2017‍–‍18.

Vafaei described the missed red in the deciding frame as "unforgivable" [28]. He added: "I'm very happy to get the victory. He  [O'Sullivan] is my hero.

## Later rounds

### Quarter-finals

The quarter-finals were played on 22 March as the best of nine frames. Page made breaks of 90 and 140 to lead Slessor 2‍–‍0, and Slessor won the next two frames to level the match at 2‍–‍2 at the mid‑session interval [1] [12]. However, Page took three consecutive frames with breaks of 78, 76, and 87 to win 5‍–‍2, reaching the first ranking semi‑final of his career. The match between defending champion Trump and 2017 runner‑up Kyren Wilson was also drawn at 2‍–‍2 at the mid‑session interval. After a re‑rack, Wilson took on a 58‍–‍1 lead in the fifth frame, and Trump narrowed the score to 39‍–‍58 after a long safety battle over the yellow, which he potted. Trump then fluked both the green and brown, and went on to win the frame on the last black. Trump extended his lead to 4‍–‍2 with a 59 break in the sixth frame. Wilson made a break of 60 in frame seven, but overcut a red, allowing Trump to capture the frame and a 5‍–‍2 victory. Commenting on his win, Trump said: "There seems to be players I have a good record against recently [33]. Kyren  [Wilson] is one of them. It always helps when you know what you have to do. You have to turn up and be solid against him. It makes my job easy knowing I have to go out and play well." [34]. Winner of the 2017 event Ding made breaks of 73, 74, 135, and 102 to complete a 5‍–‍0 win over Vafaei. Two‑time champion Neil Robertson led Hawkins 3‍–‍1 at the mid‑session interval, helped by breaks of 127, 87, and 87. Robertson went on to make 115 and 79 breaks to claim a 5‍–‍2 victory. He said: "My game is absolutely back to where it should be now and that is really exciting heading into the back end of the season [35]. It is a blockbuster match tomorrow  [against Ding]. If you can't enjoy playing Ding in a semi‑final in China then there's something wrong." [36] [37]. 

### Semi-finals

The semi-finals were played on 23 March as the best of 11 frames. The first semi‑final was played between Page, who had never progressed past the last‑16 stage of a ranking tournament prior to the event, and Trump, who was playing his 61st career ranking semi‑final [1] [12]. Before the match began, Page accidentally cut his finger while retrieving his cue from its case. He commented after the match: "I was praying for it not to bleed, but then it started bleeding. I tried putting a plaster on, but then I couldn't feel the cue so I had to take it off. It's not an ideal start in your first semi‑final."  Trump won the opening frame with a century break of 122, and Page levelled the match to 2‍–‍2 [38]. However, Trump won four frames in a row after the mid‑session interval to claim a 6‍–‍2 victory and reach his seventh ranking final of the season. He said: "It was a scrappy game, neither of us played well, we both missed a lot of balls [39] [40]. It was Jackson's  [Page's] first semi‑final and he didn't really settle, my experience probably made the difference." [38]. Ding and Neil Robertson contested the second semi‑final. Robertson established a 3‍–‍1 advantage at the mid‑session interval with a break of 118 in the fourth frame, but Ding claimed the next three frames to lead 4‍–‍3. Robertson regained the lead by winning frames eight and nine with breaks of 55 and 128. In the ninth frame, Robertson made a break of 36 before missing a red as he had to bridge over another ball, allowing Ding to even the match to 5‍–‍5 with a 68 break. Robertson had the first chance in the deciding frame, but had to play safe when he lost position on the next red after potting the pink, scoring 53. Ding then narrowed his deficit to 44‍–‍56, and capitalised on Robertson's safety error on the last red to secure a 6‍–‍5 victory on the last pink. Ding punched the table in celebration, as he had defeated Robertson for the first time since the 2014 China Open final,  and reached the second ranking final of the season, after the 2023 UK Championship [41]. Ding said: "I can't feel my legs, there was so much pressure on me [42] [40]. When I got the chance in the last frame, I thought I was going to win, but there was pressure on every shot. When I potted the pink I tried to enjoy the moment."  The loss meant that Robertson's ranking has dropped out of the top 16, a position he had held since 2006 [43]. He also had to qualify for the World Championship for the first time since 2006. Robertson described the loss as "tough one to take", commenting on social media that he "played three brilliant frames  [from 3‍–‍4 behind] but wasn't meant to be, just a centimetre out here or there on match ball and couldn't get through." [43].
