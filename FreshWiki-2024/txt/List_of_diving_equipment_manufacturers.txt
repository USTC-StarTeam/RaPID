List_of_diving_equipment_manufacturers

Diving equipment, or underwater diving equipment, is equipment used by underwater divers to make diving activities possible, easier, safer and/or more comfortable. This may be equipment primarily intended for this purpose, or equipment intended for other purposes which is found to be suitable for diving use.
This is a list of manufacturers of equipment specifically intended for use for underwater diving, though they may also manufacture equipment for other applications
The fundamental item of diving equipment used by divers other than freedivers, is underwater breathing apparatus, such as scuba equipment, and surface-supplied diving equipment, but there are other important items of equipment that make diving safer, more convenient or more efficient. Diving equipment used by recreational scuba divers, also known as scuba gear, is mostly personal equipment carried by the diver, but professional divers, particularly when operating in the surface-supplied or saturation mode, use a large amount of diving support equipment not carried by the diver.
Equipment which is used for underwater work or other activities which is not directly related to the activity of diving, or which has not been designed or modified specifically for underwater use by divers is generally not considered to be diving equipment.
The list is laid out alphabetical order and lists types of diving equipment manufactured and brand names associated with each entity. Several brands were originally the names of independent manufacturers, which have subsequently changed ownership, and may be listed both as a brand and a manufacturer. Some manufacturers were only active for a few years, and some changed their name and brands several times. There are a few which accumulated others by mergers and purchases, and consequently own a large number of brands, some of which may then quietly disappear from the market.
