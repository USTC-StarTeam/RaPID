Miss Grand International 2024 was the 12th Miss Grand International pageant, held at the MGI Hall in Bangkok, Thailand, on 25 October 2024. Contestants from 68 countries and territories competed for the title.

# Background

## Location and date

In June 2022, the president of the contest, Nawat Itsaragrisil, stated that the host country for Miss Grand International 2025 was already decided but could not be revealed for contractual reasons,    while the host country for the 2024 edition was in the process of negotiation [12] [13] [14]. The mutual agreement between Myanmar and the Miss Grand International PCL was reached in July 2022, with the memorandum of understanding between the local organizer, Glamorous International, and the MGI PCL, signed in early 2023, at the MGI Hall, Bangkok, Thailand. It was then officially announced on the grand final stage of Miss Grand International 2023 on 25 October 2023;  however, Miss Grand International Organization later announced on 22 May 2024 that Myanmar was no longer the host country for the contest due to domestic political crisis [15] [16]. Cambodia and Thailand were elected as the replacements [17]. Initially, the pageant was scheduled for Cambodia from 3 – 15 October 2024, and included one of the main events, the best-in-swimsuit contest on 9 October. The remaining sub-contests, including the national costume contest, the preliminary round, and the grand final, was set for Thailand. It was announced on 6 October that all the remaining sub-contests would be relocated to Thailand due to the Cambodian organizer's  contractual failures and conflicts between the domestic organizer and Miss Grand International organisation [18] [19]. The licence of Miss Grand Cambodia organizer, HK7 Co., Ltd., was removed by the Miss Grand International company [20]. On October 8, Nawat Itsaragrisil held a press conference with the Thai media regarding host country issues and announced that, in addition to Bangkok, the pageant's activities were scheduled in Pattaya from 11 – 16 October [21]. 

## Selection of participants

Three delegates won their titles as a supplemental title in a multiple-award national pageant. Thirty-two delegates were appointed to their titles without competing in a 2024 national pageant.. 

## Debuts, returns and withdrawals

In addition to the debut of Greenland,  this edition has the returns of Cameroon and Côte d'Ivoire which last competed in 2014; New Zealand and Tanzania in 2018; Macau in 2019; Armenia in 2021; and Bangladesh, China, Curaçao and Pakistan in 2022. [23]. Eight countries that competed at Miss Grand International 2023 did not select nor appoint a representative for this edition. Latvia and Portugal appointed a representative,  but both of them did not compete for undisclosed reasons. [24]. Five delegates withdrew during the pageant camp: Sotheary Bee of Cambodia, who withdrew from the competition due to the conflict between her director and the Miss Grand International organization,  while Macarena Chamberlain of Costa Rica, Kaylie Cheung of Hong Kong and Kateryna Bilyk of Ukraine withdrew due to health issues [25]. Madeleine Malmberg of Norway did not attend the final night for undisclosed reasons. [26] [27] [28].
