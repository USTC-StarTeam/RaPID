Goulburn_Valley_Football_Netball_League

The Goulburn Valley Football Netball League (GVFNL) is an Australian rules football and netball competition based in the Goulburn Valley region of Victoria, Australia. It is a member of the Victorian Country Football League and has won the Victorian Country Football Championships in 2003 and 2005.

# History

The league was initially called the Goulburn Valley District Football Association (GVDFA) and dates back to May, 1893. Clubs from the townships of Kyabram, Mooroopna, Nagambie, Nathalia, Numurkah, Shepparton, Shepparton Ramblers, Tatura, Undera and Wunghnu were present at the inaugural meeting, with club's deciding to play on a Wednesday afternoon. The five original clubs that chose to play on Wednesdays that made up the 1893 GVDFA draw were – Kyabram, Mooroopna, Shepparton, Shepparton Ramblers and Tatura  with Mooroopna defeating the Shepparton Ramblers in the 1893 GVDFA grand final [2]. In 1894, the following six teams competed in the Goulburn Valley District Football Association - Kyabram, Mooroopna, Shepparton, Shepparton Ramblers, Tatura and Undera. Murchison came into the GVDFA in 1895 and Kyabram did not join , but were active playing a number of friendly matches against other local teams. [8]. In 1896, the Shepparton FC and Shepparton Ramblers FC merged to form the "Shepparton and Ramblers United FC" and wore the following colors - blue and white jumper, with a yellow band, white knicks and black and yellow socks. As the GVDFA went into recess in 1897, this newly merged club appears to of reformed in 1898 in the GFDVA as just the Shepparton FC. In 1910, Shepparton Imperials defeated Kialla in the East and West Goulburn Valley Football Association grand final. At the 1914 – GVDFA – Annual General Meeting, the club delegate's voted to change the name of the competition to the Goulburn Valley Football League to save a lot of confusion with another local football competition, the Goulburn Valley Football Association, which was based out of Numurkah, which was made up from club's in the northern Goulburn Valley region. Later clubs from Rushworth, Murchison, Tongala and Echuca would spend time in this league.. In 1924, the Goulburn Valley Football League: 15.17 - 107 defeated Collingwood: 14.15 - 99. Between 1926 and 1936, there was a Goulburn Valley Second Eighteens Football Association competition that was based in and around Shepparton, that was superseded by the Goulburn Valley Football Association in 1937.. Rushworth FC had a golden era between 1929 and 1940, where they played off in ten grand finals and they managed to win five premierships. Rushworth footballer, Bernie Collins played in Rushworth's four premierships from 1930 to 1933, then moved to Shepparton with his employment and then played in Shepparton's 1934 premiership too.. In 1935, Mooroopna FC pulled out the GVFL  and played in the Goulburn Valley Second Eighteens Football Association competition [14]. Prior to World War II this league used to play on Wednesday afternoon, but in 1939 the league decided to change to Saturday afternoon, Shepparton and Mooroopna objected and refused to play on Saturdays so both clubs went into recess.. In 1948, the GVFL introduced the Reserves football competition,   with Kyabram taking out the first premiership. [16] [17]. In 1995 the league absorbed the clubs from the Tungamah Football League and had a second division for three seasons (1996–1998). These second division clubs left and formed the Central Goulburn Football League in 1999. This league ceased in 2005.. Kyabram FC seniors went through 2016 and 2017 as undefeated premiers and were still undefeated leading into the 2018 grand final, but lost to Shepparton FC, ending a winning streak of 62 games, which is a GVFNL record. Kyabram then went onto be undefeated premiers in 2019, thus only losing one game since their 2015 GVFNL grand final loss to Benalla FC. 

# Grand Finals

The GVFNL grand final has been held continuously at Deakin Reserve, Shepparton since 1957. Since 1992, the best player on the ground in the GVFNL grand final has been awarded the Wilfred Cox Medal.. 

# Medal winners / Leading Goalkickers

The GVFNL senior football best and fairest award is voted on by the GVFNL's match day umpires in the form of three, two and one votes awarded to the best three players in each match of the round..
