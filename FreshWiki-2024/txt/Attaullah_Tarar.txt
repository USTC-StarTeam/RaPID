Attaullah_Tarar

Attaullah Tarar   (Urdu/Punjabi: عطاء اللہ تارڑ) is a Pakistani politician who is the current Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting, in office since 11 March 2024. He has been a Member of the National Assembly of Pakistan since February 2024.

# Violent crackdown on Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf protesters

During the events surrounding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) march towards Islamabad’s D Chowk in November 2024, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Attaullah Tarar, publicly threatened PTI protesters on mainstream media. The protest was aimed at demanding the release of their leader, Imran Khan. Tarar explicitly warned that military forces and ammunition would be used against the protesters to disrupt their march. This threat was later acknowledged by leaders within the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), including Mohsin Naqvi, indicating their involvement in the response to the protest. Reports and sources suggest that during the crackdown at D Chowk, military forces employed American-made sniper rifles and automatic guns, resulting in significant violence. There were claims of 18 fatalities, numerous abductions, and several protesters reported missing during this operation. These actions were characterized by some as a severe violation of protest rights, with the use of live ammunition being a contentious point. The narrative around these events varies, with the government denying the use of live rounds and asserting control over the situation post-protest, while PTI leaders and supporters have described the incident as a “massacre” and accused the authorities of using excessive force. The exact details, including the number of casualties, remain disputed, with government officials challenging the PTI to provide proof of their claims.

# Political career

In December 2021, a First Information Report (FIR) was filed against Tarar after he, along with a mob of armed individuals, forcibly entered the residence of Syed Mir Wasiq, a candidate of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) during the by-election in Khanewal. Allegations were made that Tarar threatened, intimidated, and harassed women and family members of Wasiq. He held the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) and has previously served as an additional secretary. On 24 May 2022, Chief Minister of Punjab Hamza Shahbaz appointed him as the spokesperson of the Government of Punjab, on an honorary and non-remunerative basis. On May 30, 2022, Tarar was appointed as the Home Minister in the shortlived cabinet of Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Shahbaz [4]. In June 2022, he faced criticism on social media after a video of him went viral, wherein he was observed displaying the middle finger in the Punjab Assembly, while holding a copy of the Constitution. After facing criticism on social media for allegedly showing disrespect towards the Constitution and violating the decorum of the Assembly, Atta posted an "apology". On July 28, 2022, he was appointed as the Special Assistant to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, with the status of a Federal Minister. On December 16, 2022, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif appointed Tarar as his special assistant on interior and legal affairs. Following the May 9 riots, he held frequent media interactions, criticizing Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan. In 2022, Farah Khan, a friend of Bushra Bibi, issued a final legal notice to Tarar, asking him to stop making defamatory statements about her. He was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan as a candidate of PML-N from Constituency NA-127 Lahore-XI in 2024 Pakistani general election. He received 98,210 votes and defeated PTI-backed independent candidate Malik Zaheer Abbas who received 82,230 votes and also Bilawal Bhutto Zardari who received 15,005 votes [11]. However, Malik Zaheer Abbas contested Tarar's election victory in court, accusing the Election Commission of Pakistan of manipulating and forging Forms 45 and 47 to declare Tarar the winning candidate [12]. On 11 March, he was inducted into the federal cabinet of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and was appointed as Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting. On May 17, 2024 Tarar was assigned additional portfolio of National Heritage and Culture [14]. In May 2024, during Shehbaz Sharif's visit to Iran, Tarar, acted as his personal photographer upon landing at the airport, which prompted criticism from the public.
