2024_New_Hampshire_Republican_presidential_primary

The 2024 New Hampshire Republican presidential primary was held on January 23, 2024, as part of the Republican Party primaries for the 2024 presidential election.
22 delegates to the 2024 Republican National Convention were allocated on a proportional basis, as long as the candidate received at least 10% of the statewide vote. Any leftover delegates were to be added to the candidate that receives the most votes in the primary. The New Hampshire primary was the second contest in the nation, held after the Iowa caucuses. The primary was won by former President Donald Trump, defeating former U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.
After most polls closed at 8:00 PM EST, media outlets began projecting a win for Trump. Trump's eleven-point lead wound up equating to an edge just under 36,000 votes. Despite calls to drop out, Haley declined to withdraw from the race after the primary. Trump became the first non-incumbent Republican candidate in American history to win both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary in the same election cycle. Trump also broke the record of number of votes received for any candidate in New Hampshire primary history.

# Background

Donald Trump won the 2016 New Hampshire Republican primary with 35.2% of the vote, with closest opponent John Kasich coming in second with 15.7% of the vote. Exit polling by Edison Research concluded that Trump's 2016 primary victory could be credited to support among white voters without a college degree, as well as support from moderate voters. 

# Procedure

Delegates are proportionally allocated to candidates who received at least 10% of the statewide vote. 

# Candidates

The following candidates officially filed by the end of the filing deadline on October 27, 2023: [9]. 

# Campaign

In January 2023, Trump selected outgoing New Hampshire Republican Party chair Stephen Stepanek to oversee his campaign's operations in the state. Nikki Haley's campaign purchased $10 million worth of ads to run in New Hampshire and Iowa beginning in December 2023. New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, who considered a presidential candidacy, established a "Live Free or Die committee",  though he announced on June 5 that he would not be running for the Republican nomination [21].
