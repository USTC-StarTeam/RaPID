  "summary": "Hurricane Debby was a slow-moving, destructive and erratic tropical cyclone that caused widespread severe flooding across the Southeastern United States and portions of Atlantic Canada, becoming the costliest natural disaster in the history of the province of Quebec. The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, Debby developed from a tropical wave that was first noted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on July 26. After crossing the Greater Antilles, the system began to organize over Cuba and was designated a potential tropical cyclone on August 2. After exiting off the southern coast of Cuba, the disturbance organized into a tropical depression early on August 3. \nLater that day, it became a tropical storm in the Florida Straits, being named Debby. It moved northwards and gradually intensified into a Category 1 hurricane before making landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, early on August 5. Debby weakened once inland and began to slow down over the Southeastern United States, causing widespread flooding from heavy rain. It re-emerged in the Atlantic on August 7 before slowly moving northwards again, making landfall in South Carolina early on August 8 before weakening and becoming post-tropical the next day. It continued inland over the United States before traversing Atlantic Canada, after which it moved back out to sea.\nStates of emergency were declared for the states of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia ahead of the storm. Heavy rainfall was exacerbated by Debby's slow motion, with accumulations peaking near 20 inches (510 mm) near Sarasota, Florida as of August 7. Two dozen tornadoes were confirmed as the storm also moved up the East coast of the United States. In Quebec, rainfall totals peaked at 8.7 inches (220 mm), generating destructive floods. 18 fatalities have been attributed to the storm, and preliminary damage reports are estimated to US$4.3 billion.",
