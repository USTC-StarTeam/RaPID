  "summary": "Hurricane Rafael was the strongest November tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico on record, tied with 1985's Hurricane Kate. The seventeenth named storm, eleventh hurricane, and fifth major hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, Rafael formed on November 4, 2024 from an area of low-pressure spawned by a Central American gyre. Steady organization occurred throughout the next two days, with Rafael becoming a hurricane early on November 6, as it moved northwest towards Cuba. Favorable conditions enabled the cyclone to rapidly intensify, becoming a Category 3 major hurricane later that day before landfall in Cuba. Then, after weakening some while over land, it entered the Gulf of Mexico and re-intensified to a major hurricane once again at peak intensity early on November 8. Hostile conditions, including wind shear and cooler sea-surface temperatures, caused the hurricane to rapidly weaken afterward, falling below hurricane intensity later that day, and eventually degenerating into a remnant low on November 10. The circulation opened up into a trough the next day.\nTwo deaths have been confirmed in Jamaica as a result of flooding caused by Rafael. Additionally, at least five deaths in Panama occurred due to heavy flooding and landslides produced by Rafael's precursor disturbance, along with one death in Colombia. Preliminary damages are estimated to be at least US$1.2 billion.",
