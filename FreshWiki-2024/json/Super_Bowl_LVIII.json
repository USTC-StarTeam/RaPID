  "summary": "Super Bowl LVIII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2023 season. In a rematch of Super Bowl LIV from four years earlier, the American Football Conference (AFC) champion and defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers 25\u201322 in overtime. The Chiefs became the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowls since the 2004 New England Patriots. The game was played on February 11, 2024, at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada. This was the first Super Bowl to be held in the state of Nevada. It marked the third straight year that the Super Bowl had been played in the Western United States, following host cities Inglewood, California, in 2022 and Glendale, Arizona, in 2023.\nAs this was the Chiefs' fourth Super Bowl appearance and third win in five years, many have said this game established them as a dynasty. It was the second Super Bowl to be decided in overtime, the first being Super Bowl LI, seven years earlier. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was named Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (MVP), completing 34 of 46 passes for 333 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. Due to the seating capacity of Allegiant Stadium, the game's sellout attendance of 61,629 was the smallest unrestricted crowd in Super Bowl history, and the smallest unrestricted NFL Championship attendance since December 1946 (58,346).\nThe game was televised nationally by CBS, streamed on Paramount+, alternatively broadcast on youth-oriented sister network Nickelodeon, and televised on the Spanish-language network Univision. It was also the second simulcast in Super Bowl history, and the first since Super Bowl I. Super Bowl LVIII became the most watched program in American television history, with a total of 123.7 million average viewers across all platforms, which broke the average record of 115.1 million viewers set by the previous year's Super Bowl. The game saw the highest unduplicated total audience in history with more than 200 million viewers watching all or part of the game. It was the most-watched United States broadcast since the Apollo 11 moon landing, attributed to the Taylor Swift effect. The halftime show, headlined by Usher, peaked at 129.3 million viewers. The game's net playing time of 74 minutes and 57 seconds ranks as the longest in Super Bowl history.\nIt was notable for being the first Super Bowl since its inception that George Toma did not serve as groundskeeper.",
