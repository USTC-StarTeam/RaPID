  "summary": "The battle of Avdiivka was a major battle between the Russian and Ukrainian Armed Forces for control of Avdiivka, a city in Donetsk Oblast, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. After more than a year and a half of intermittent fighting along the city's outskirts, Russian forces launched an offensive to capture Avdiivka on 10 October 2023, resulting in what was considered one of the bloodiest and fiercest battles of the war.\nAvdiivka was one of the most fortified settlements in Ukraine and had been described as a \"gateway\" to the nearby provincial capital of Donetsk. Ukraine's control of Avdiivka had prevented Russian forces from using Donetsk and its resources as a communications hub and prevented Russian breakthroughs on this axis.\nOn 17 February 2024, with the last Ukrainian supply routes into the city under serious threat, commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced that Ukrainian forces were being withdrawn from the city \"to avoid encirclement and preserve the lives and health of service personnel.\"\nThe capture of Avdiivka was Russia's largest territorial advance since capturing Bakhmut in May 2023, and was considered a sign that Russian forces had retaken the initiative in the war after the failure of the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive. The battle for Avdiivka came to be known as the \"second Bakhmut\", or \"Bakhmut 2.0\", due to the similarities in battlefield conditions, Russian tactics, and reported casualty rates. It has been noted that Russian forces may have lost more soldiers during the battle, according to Ukrainian estimates and pro-Russian bloggers, than during the entirety of the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. Though casualty figures for both sides remain impossible to verify.",
