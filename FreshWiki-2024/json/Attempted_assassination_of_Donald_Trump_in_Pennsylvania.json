  "summary": "On July 13, 2024, Donald Trump, the then-former president of the United States and then-presumptive nominee of the Republican Party in the 2024 presidential election, survived an assassination attempt while speaking at an open-air campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was shot and wounded in his upper right ear by Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, who fired eight rounds from an AR-15\u2013style rifle from the roof of a nearby building. Crooks also killed one audience member and critically injured two others. After being shot at by a member of the Butler County's Emergency Services Unit, who hit Crooks's rifle and stopped the shots, Crooks was shot and killed 10 seconds later by the United States Secret Service's Counter Sniper Team.\nAs shots were fired, Trump clasped his ear and took cover behind his lectern, where Secret Service agents shielded him until the shooter was killed. Evan Vucci, a photojournalist for the Associated Press, captured photographs of Trump with blood on his face and ear, pumping his fist in the air and saying \"Fight!\" as agents escorted him offstage; the images went viral on social media. Trump was taken to a hospital, treated, and released later that day. He made his first public appearance after the shooting two days later at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, wearing a bandage on his ear.\nThe incident is regarded as the most significant security failure by the Secret Service since the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981. The director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, faced bipartisan calls for her resignation when she testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability on July 22; she stepped down the following day. President Joe Biden ordered an independent review of the security arrangements, condemned the violence, and called for a reduction in heated political rhetoric, emphasizing the importance of resolving political differences peacefully. Misinformation and conspiracy theories spread on social media after the shooting. Lawmakers called for increased security for major candidates in the election, and the Secret Service subsequently approved enhanced security measures, including the use of bulletproof glass at Trump's outdoor rallies.",
