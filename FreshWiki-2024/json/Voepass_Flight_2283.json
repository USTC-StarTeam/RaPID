  "summary": "Voepass Flight 2283 was a scheduled domestic Brazilian passenger flight from Cascavel to Guarulhos. On 9 August 2024, the ATR 72-500 serving the flight crashed in Vinhedo, S\u00e3o Paulo State. The aircraft was flying at an altitude of 17,000 ft (5,200 m) prior to stalling and entering a flat spin with a rapid descent at around 13:21 BRT.\nAll 62 people on board died. The crash was the deadliest aviation accident in Brazil since TAM Airlines Flight 3054 in July 2007. The Brazilian Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA) has launched an investigation into the accident. In the initial aftermath of the accident, aviation experts speculated that ice buildup could have been a factor. Both flight recorders were recovered and analyzed by CENIPA, who issued a preliminary report confirming the pilots faced difficulties with icing buildup and de-icing attempts.",
