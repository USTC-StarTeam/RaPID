  "summary": "Creature Commandos is an adult animated superhero television series based on the eponymous team from DC Comics. Produced by DC Studios and Warner Bros. Animation, it is the first television series and the first installment in the DC Universe (DCU). The series focuses on a black ops team of monsters assembled by Amanda Waller. All seven episodes of the first season were written by series creator James Gunn, with Dean Lorey serving as showrunner and Yves \"Balak\" Bigerel as supervising director.\nThe series features an ensemble cast including Indira Varma, Sean Gunn, Alan Tudyk, Zo\u00eb Chao, David Harbour, and Frank Grillo. After James Gunn and Peter Safran became co-CEOs of DC Studios in October 2022, they announced Creature Commandos in January 2023. Production on the series had begun by then and casting was underway. The cast was announced that April. Bobbypills and Studio IAM provided animation for the series.\nCreature Commandos premiered on the streaming service Max on December 5, 2024, with its first two episodes. The series received positive reviews from critics, who praised the voice performances, animation, and Gunn's storytelling. It is the first entry in the DCU's Chapter One: Gods and Monsters. In December 2024, the series was renewed for a second season.",
