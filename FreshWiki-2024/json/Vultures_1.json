  "summary": "Vultures 1 is the debut studio album by the American hip hop supergroup \u00a5$, composed of the rapper Kanye West and the singer Ty Dolla Sign. It was released independently by the former's YZY brand on February 10, 2024. Guest appearances include West's daughter North, India Love, Freddie Gibbs, YG, Nipsey Hussle, Quavo, Playboi Carti, Travis Scott, Bump J, Lil Durk, Rich the Kid and Chris Brown. Production was primarily handled by West and Ty Dolla Sign themselves, alongside the Legendary Traxster, 88-Keys, Camper, JPEGMafia, Timbaland, Swizz Beatz, Ojivolta, Chrishan,  Anthony Kilhoffer, and others.\nWest and Ty Dolla Sign began recording the album with collaborators in Italy in October 2023, then relocated to Saudi Arabia for three months. It sustained multiple delays and changes to the tracklist before release, following West's struggles to secure a distributor. The release was first teased throughout late 2023 under the placeholder title \u00a5$ and was set to be titled Vultures before being retitled to Vultures 1 as the first volume in an album series. The tracks \"Everybody\" and \"New Body\" were announced for the album, but could not be included due to clearance issues. West and Ty Dolla Sign previewed tracks at the Vultures Rave listening party in December 2023, two months before holding numerous public events in Chicago, New York, and Milan. The album was initially distributed using the FUGA platform, allegedly in violation of FUGA's service agreement, and a withdrawal was made from streaming services on February 15, 2024. However, it was then re-distributed by Label Engine the same day.\nIn contrast to West's previous two albums, Jesus Is King (2019) and Donda (2021), Vultures 1 finds him forgoing religious themes and addressing his preceding controversies, as well as themes of money, relationships, sex, and fame. It also sees him returning to an explicit tracklist, with his previous three albums only featuring tracks with clean or censored lyrics. The cover art features West dressed in all-black with his hockey mask, joined by his partner Bianca Censori. The title track was issued as the album's lead single in November 2023, followed three months later by \"Talking / Once Again\" and \"Carnival\", the latter of which topped the US Billboard Hot 100. Music videos were produced for all of the singles, with a new version of \"Vultures\" produced by Havoc being used for the song's visual.\nReleased somewhat shortly after West's antisemitic comments, Vultures 1 received mixed reviews from music critics, many of whom criticized its lyrics regarding the matter\u2014as well as his other controversies. However, some complimented the production and Ty Dolla Sign's contributions. The album marked West's 11th consecutive number-one debut on the US Billboard 200, breaking his tie with Eminem. It topped the charts in several other countries, including Australia, Canada, and Germany, becoming West's first number-one album in the latter country. Vultures 1 was certified gold and silver in the United States and the United Kingdom by the Recording Industry Association of America and British Phonographic Industry, respectively. All of the songs entered the Billboard Hot 100, bringing West to 157 career entries. A sequel album, Vultures 2, was released on August 3, 2024, with Vultures 3 also slated for a release indefinitely. The performers are scheduled to embark on a world tour in support of the album from 2024 to 2025, planned for cities such as New York and London.",
