  "summary": "Mikheil Kavelashvili (Georgian: \u10db\u10d8\u10ee\u10d4\u10d8\u10da \u10e7\u10d0\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10d0\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 [mi\u03c7eil q\u02bcave\u026ba\u0283\u02b7ili]; born 22 July 1971) is a Georgian politician and former professional footballer who was sworn in as the sixth president of Georgia on 29 December 2024. His election was boycotted and disputed by the opposition, as well as by significant parts of the international community. He was the sole candidate on the ballot \u2013 the first time in Georgia's history that voters were given only one choice during a presidential election.\nAs a football player, he was a striker who notably played in the English Premier League for Manchester City and in the Swiss Super League for a range of clubs. He also played for Dinamo Tbilisi and Spartak Vladikavkaz. He was capped 46 times by the Georgian national football team, scoring nine goals.\nKavelashvili was first elected to parliament in the 2016 election as part of the ruling Georgian Dream party. In 2022, he co-founded the anti-Western People's Power party, a satellite organization created and controlled by GD. He was nominated as the candidate for the presidency of Georgia in November 2024, although the powers of the president have been substantially limited following the 2017 Georgian constitutional reform which transformed the country into a parliamentary republic. His election as president was declared \"illegitimate\" by the opposition, outgoing president Salome Zourabichvili, watchdog organizations and Georgian constitutional experts.",
