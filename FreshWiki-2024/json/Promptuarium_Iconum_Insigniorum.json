  "summary": "Prima [et Secunda] pars Promptuarii iconum insigniorum \u00e0 seculo hominum, subiectis eorum vitis, per compendium ex probatissimis autoribus desumptis. (Latin for 'The First [and Second] Part of the Storehouse of Images of the More Notable Men from the Beginning of Time, with Their Biographies Subjoined, Taken in Abbreviated Form from the Most Approved Authors.'), often abbreviated as Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum or Promptuarium Iconum, is an iconographic compilation of woodcut portraits published in 1553 by Guillaume Rouill\u00e9, a French merchant-publisher active in early modern Lyon's book trade. Originally released in Latin, French, and Italian editions, the book features portrait engravings in a medallion format, arranged in a primarily chronological order from Old Testament figures and Greco-Roman deities through mid-16th-century contemporaries. Many of these portraits are fictitious, relying on Rouill\u00e9's physiognomic interpretations and the engraver's artistic license. The engraver is unnamed in the text; 19th-century bibliographer Henri-Louis Baudrier attributed the portraits to the artist Georges Reverdy.\nThe book is divided into two sections: Prima pars ('First Part'), covering figures predating Christ, and Pars secunda ('Second Part'), documenting individuals from the Christian era onward. Published as a single volume, these sections maintain separate pagination systems. The first editions each contained 828 portraits with accompanying biographical summaries, though the textual authorship remains debated. The book's commercial success led to subsequent editions in multiple languages, which included a Spanish edition in 1561. The 1577 French edition expanded the collection with approximately 100 additional engravings, placing greater emphasis on Renaissance humanist scholars. The portraits overall emulate ancient coinage designs, yet they lack the numismatic detail required for scholarly reference. Rouill\u00e9's aim was to distill complex histories into standardized imagery and concise narratives, so that the past was made accessible for a general audience. The compilation influenced European iconographic collections over the following decades, shaping their portrayal of historical figures from the latter half of the 16th century well into the 17th.",
