  "summary": "On 11 November 2024, a man drove his SUV into people on the exercise track at the Zhuhai Stadium sports center in Zhuhai, Guangdong, China, killing 35 and injuring 43 more. The driver then attempted to commit suicide by cutting himself with a knife; he was taken into custody and sent to a hospital. The man is believed to have been motivated by anger over a recent divorce settlement. On 27 December, he was sentenced to death and executed on 20 January 2025.\nVideos and coverage of the attack were censored online. Details about it were not released until the following day, a delay that drew heavy criticism on Chinese social media platforms. It is the deadliest vehicle-ramming attack in China since the May 2014 \u00dcr\u00fcmqi attack.",
