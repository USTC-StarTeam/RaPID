  "summary": "The 2024 British Columbia general election was held on October 19, 2024, to elect 93 members (MLAs) of the Legislative Assembly to serve in the 43rd parliament of the Canadian province of British Columbia.\nThe election was the first to be held since a significant redistribution of electoral boundaries was finalised in 2023. The Legislative Assembly also expanded in size from 87 seats to 93 seats. The election saw a broad political realignment in British Columbia; amid a resurgence for the Conservative Party of British Columbia, the official opposition BC United (formerly the BC Liberals) withdrew from the race a little over a month before the election to avoid splitting the vote. BC United formally endorsed the Conservatives, with several BC United candidates either defecting to the Conservatives or standing as independent or unaligned candidates; this marked the party's first absence from a provincial election since 1900.\nThe preliminary vote count was completed on October 20 with a record 2,037,897 votes cast in total. A final count triggered automatic recounts in close races, as well the inclusion of approximately 65,000 out-of-district and mail-in ballots. The NDP won a third term in government and second consecutive majority government, but with a net loss of eight seats. It was the first time that the NDP had won three consecutive elections. The Conservatives formed the official opposition, with their best electoral performance in 72 years.",
