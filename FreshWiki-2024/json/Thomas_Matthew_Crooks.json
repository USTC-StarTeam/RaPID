  "summary": "Thomas Matthew Crooks (September 20, 2003 \u2013 July 13, 2024) was an American man who attempted to assassinate former U.S. president Donald Trump, who at the time was the presumptive Republican Party nominee for the 2024 presidential election.\nOn July 13, 2024, at a rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, Crooks shot at Trump with an AR-15\u2013style rifle from a nearby rooftop while Trump was giving a speech. Crooks wounded Trump's ear and killed one attendee while critically injuring two others before being killed by a Secret Service counter sniper team. His motive remains unknown. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating the case. Trump would go on to win the 2024 election less than four months later.\nEvidence on his political views remains inconclusive. In January 2021, he donated $15 to a voter turnout group with a Democratic platform. When he reached the voting age of 18 in September 2021, he registered to vote in Pennsylvania as a member of the Republican Party and remained registered as a Republican until his death.",
