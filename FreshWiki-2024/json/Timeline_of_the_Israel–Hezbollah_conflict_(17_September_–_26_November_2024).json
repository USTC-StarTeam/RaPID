  "summary": "This timeline of the Israel\u2013Hezbollah conflict covers the period that begins 17 September 2024, when Hezbollah pagers exploded throughout Lebanon and Syria, and ends prior to 27 November 2024, when the 2024 Israel\u2013Lebanon ceasefire agreement was signed. Beginning 23 September, Israel began its airstrikes in Lebanon, on 27 September, they assassinated Hassan Nasrallah, and on 1 October, they invaded Lebanon.\nBrief description of major events during this period:\n\n17 September: Hours after the Security Cabinet of Israel declares that returning the residents of the north of Israel to their homes is a new goal of the war, Hezbollah pagers explode throughout Lebanon and Syria, killing 12 and injuring 2,750. Both militants and civilians among the killed, and injured.\n18 September: Hezbollah walkie-talkies explode in the second wave of device explosions. 30 people are killed, with civilians being injured and some potentially killed.\n20 September: 20 September 2024 Beirut attack, Hezbollah generals Ibrahim Aqil and Ahmed Wehbe killed, along with at least 29 civilians when an Israeli airstrike destroyed an apartment building.\nBeginning 23 September: Israel begins hitting targets in Lebanon in multiple airstrikes, killing at least 700 people so far and vowing to continue strikes. Lebanon's foreign minister Abdallah Bou Habib says that nearly 500,000 people have been displaced due to the attacks. Israel has refused calls for de-escalation, such as a 21-day ceasefire plan presented by France and the US, with Benjamin Netanyahu saying the strikes will continue \"with full force\" until the new war aim of returning residents of Israel to the north is met.\n23 September: Israel conducted mass airstrikes, a major escalation of the conflict. Residents were given only hours of notice to evacuate. Airstrikes were conducted all over Lebanon but focused on Southern Lebanon with its heavy Hezbollah presence. Roads were jammed with people fleeing, in some cases using both directions of roads to escape, with a road in Sidon having a 10 lane wide traffic jam on both sides of the road for vehicles being used to escape the airstrikes. Many civilians were killed, including 50 children. 23 September was the deadliest day of conflict in Lebanon since the Lebanese Civil War.\n27 September: Assassination of Hassan Nasrallah that  targeted multiple buildings including apartment blocks in the densely populated Dahieh suburb of Beirut. The IDF states that the target was the main Hezbollah headquarters, located underneath residential buildings which were destroyed in the attack. Nasrallah's death was confirmed by Hezbollah in the hours after the strike. The confirmed death toll is at least six, but an Israeli official estimated the true death toll as \"hundreds\", with the count set to rise in the days following the attack.\n1 October: Israel invaded Lebanon. Following the various escalations, a full-scale war was described as \"inevitable\". Following a night of heavy shelling, evacuation warnings and further airstrikes, an invasion was described as \"imminent\". Israeli then announced it had invaded Lebanon, in what it called a \"targeted and demarcated ground operation in southern Lebanon\". The 1982 invasion was similarly characterized as limited, although that sparked an occupation of 18 years.",
