  "summary": "The Necropolis of Amorosi is an ancient burial site in Amorosi, Italy, located in the region of Campania. It dates to the pre-Roman era and is associated with Italic burial practices. Discovered and excavated in 2024, excavations linked the site to the Samnite culture. Items such as pottery, ornaments, and weapons illustrate the social and cultural practices of early Italic communities.\nThe necropolis, estimated to be 2,800 years old, includes 88 pit tombs and two large tumuli. Its burial style represents the pre-Samnites Campania culture, reflecting traditions from the Iron Age to the Orientalizing period. The site's archaeological significance demonstrates its role in tracing Italic cultural traditions prior to the Roman Era.",
