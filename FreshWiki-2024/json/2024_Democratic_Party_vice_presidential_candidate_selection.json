  "summary": "Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for President of the United States in 2024, considered several prominent individuals before selecting Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota as her candidate for Vice President of the United States on August 6. Harris and Walz were certified as the official nominees that evening by Democratic National Committee secretary Jason Rae. Walz was the first sitting governor selected as the Democratic vice presidential nominee since Charles W. Bryan of Nebraska in 1924 and if elected, would have been the third vice president from Minnesota after Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale. Walz is also the first sitting governor to appear on the Democratic ticket since Bill Clinton in 1992. After formally accepting their nomination during the 2024 Democratic National Convention, the Harris\u2013Walz ticket went on to lose to the Trump\u2013Vance ticket in the general election.",
