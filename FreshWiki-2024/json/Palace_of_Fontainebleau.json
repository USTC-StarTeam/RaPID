  "summary": "Palace of Fontainebleau ( FON-tin-bloh, US also  -\u2060bloo; French: Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau [\u0283\u0251to d(\u0259) f\u0254\u0303t\u025bnblo]), located 55 kilometers (34 miles) southeast of the center of Paris, in the commune of Fontainebleau, is one of the largest French royal ch\u00e2teaux. It served as a hunting lodge and summer residence for many of the French monarchs, including Louis VII, Francis I, Henry II, Louis-Philippe, Napoleon I, and Napoleon III.  Though the monarchs only resided there for a few months of the year, they gradually transformed it into a genuine palace, filled with art and decoration. It became a national museum in 1927 and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981 for its unique architecture and historical importance.",
