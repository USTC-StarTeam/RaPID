  "summary": "The 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, known in short as the 2023 AFCON or CAN 2023 and for sponsorship purposes as the TotalEnergies 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, was the 34th edition of the biennial Africa Cup of Nations tournament organised by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). It was hosted by Ivory Coast, taking place in the country for the second time following the 1984 edition.\nThis edition of the tournament was initially planned to take place during the Northern Hemisphere's summer like the 2019 Cup, in order to reduce scheduling conflicts with European club teams and competitions. However, it was postponed by CAF to 13 January \u2013 11 February 2024 on 3 July 2022 due to the summer weather concerns in Ivory Coast, although the competition retained the original name for sponsorship purposes. This followed the previous edition in 2021 in Cameroon also being moved to the Northern Hemisphere's winter season for similar reasons, albeit coupled with postponement due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the CAF calendar.\nHost nation Ivory Coast won the tournament for their third title. They beat Nigeria 2\u20131 in the final, having also beaten defending champions Senegal in the round of 16 in a penalty shootout after the allocated playing time had ended in a 1\u20131 draw.",
