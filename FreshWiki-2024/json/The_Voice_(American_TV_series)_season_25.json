  "summary": "The twenty-fifth season of the American reality television series The Voice premiered on February 26, 2024, on NBC. The season is presented by Carson Daly, who returned as the host for his twenty-fifth season. The coaching panel consists of John Legend and Reba McEntire, who return for their ninth and second seasons, respectively; returning coach Chance the Rapper, who returns for his second season following a one-season hiatus; and debuting coaches Dan + Shay, who join the panel as the show's first coaching duo.\nAsher HaVon was named the winner of the season, marking Reba McEntire's first win as a coach. With HaVon's win, he became the fifth African-American male to win the show. He was also the first openly LGBTQ person to win. Additionally, after two attempts, McEntire became the fifth female coach to win the competition, following Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, and Gwen Stefani, as well as the oldest coach to win a season. This was the fourth season in the history of the show that a coach (McEntire) had the top two artists on their team, following Blake Shelton in seasons 3, 18, and 22.",
