  "summary": "Great Britain, (known as Team GB or the 'Great Britain and Northern Ireland Olympic Team') the team of the British Olympic Association (BOA) which represents the United Kingdom, competed at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris from 26 July to 11 August 2024. The delegation of 327 athletes included 172 women and 155 men and featured 73 medallists from previous Games. The team was made up of athletes from the whole United Kingdom including Northern Ireland (whose people may elect to hold Irish citizenship and are able to be selected to represent either Great Britain or Ireland at the Olympics). Additionally some British overseas territories - Bermuda, British Virgin Islands and Caymen Islands - compete separately from Britain in Olympic competition having received IOC recognition prior to the institution of rules restricting membership to sovereign states.\nBritish athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympic Games of the modern era, alongside Australia, France, Greece, and Switzerland, although Great Britain is the only team to have won at least one gold medal at all of them. This streak was maintained in Paris when Rosalind Canter, Laura Collett and Tom McEwen won gold in the Equestrian Team eventing competition on Day three of the Games. The first medal for the team was won on the first morning at the diving centre, where Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen won bronze in the women's synchronised 3 metre springboard, the first 'synchro' medal ever won by British women at the Olympics, and one of five diving medals won by the team.\nDuring the Games the British team won its first ever Olympic medals in sport climbing, with Toby Roberts' gold in the men's combined, and in artistic swimming, with Kate Shortman and Isabelle Thorpe taking silver in the women's duet. Meanwhile track cyclist Emma Finucane became the first British female athlete to win three medals at the same Games since Mary Rand in Tokyo in 1964.\nRowing, by gold medals (three), and cycling, by overall medals (11), were the most successful disciplines for Team GB in Paris. Great Britain won three medals in three events in triathlon, including one gold, and five medals, including two golds, from six equestrian events, with every member of the equestrian team, and all but one member of the triathlon team bringing home a medal. British athletes won medals in all four velodrome team events, all five athletics stadium relays, all four synchronised diving events, all three equestrian team events, eight rowing boats, the mixed triathlon relay and a unique second successive gold in the men's 4 \u00d7 200 metres freestyle relay for the exact same four swimmers who had previously won gold in Tokyo, a feat never achieved previously by any nation in a swimming event.\nA number of previous British Olympic champions ended their competitive career in Paris; Tom Daley announced his retirement after winning a British record fifth diving medal in five games in the men's 10 metre synchronised platform, a silver with Noah Williams, who himself later became only the third male British diver to win an individual platform medal; Andy Murray withdrew from the tennis singles but reached the quarter-finals in the men's doubles with Dan Evans in his final tournament; six time Olympic medallist Max Whitlock finished fourth in both the men's team and the individual pommel horse finals in his fourth and final Olympic Games.\n65 medals were won, the third most overall medals won by any nation in the Games after United States and China, beating the amount won in Tokyo 2020 and the lower target of 50 set by UK Sport. 14 gold medals were won, the lowest amount since Athens 2004 \u2013 leading to a final ranking of 7th in the medal table.",
