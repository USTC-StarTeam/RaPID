  "summary": "The 2024 United States drone sightings, also known as the New Jersey drone sightings, were a series of reports between November and December 2024 involving large, unidentified drones observed at night across several regions of the United States. The phenomenon began in New Jersey, where numerous sightings were reported over multiple counties. The sightings prompted concerns among residents and led to investigations by local, state, and federal authorities. Similar reports soon emerged from neighboring states, including New York and Pennsylvania. Reports of unidentified drones later expanded to other Northeastern states and eventually to the Southeast, the Midwest, and the Pacific Coast. Sightings were reported over residential areas and key infrastructure, including civilian and military sites.\nThe reported sightings were largely the result of misidentification of celestial bodies, manned aircraft, and other routine aerial objects, including hobbyist and commercial drones. Some overflights of sensitive military areas remain unresolved, though experts like Jamey Jacob have indicated they were probably \"careless actors\" and the Pentagon stated that drone flyovers are \"not unusual\" and are generally not nefarious. Commentators also attributed the sightings to widespread confirmation bias and \"mass hysteria\", and compared the rash of reports to a traditional UFO flap. A joint investigation by civilian and military agencies of the U.S. government failed to find \"anything anomalous\" and said that sightings include mistaken aircraft and other objects. State and local law enforcement as well as numerous independent experts reported similar conclusions.\nThe reported sightings and ensuing investigations prompted responses from officials at various levels of government. Representatives called for greater transparency from investigative agencies, and additional resources for state and local officials to investigate the sightings. Legislation was introduced to help address the reported sightings, and flight restrictions were imposed over sensitive infrastructure in New York and New Jersey.",
