  "summary": "Rosie is the debut solo studio album by New Zealand and South Korean singer Ros\u00e9. Released on 6 December 2024 through The Black Label and Atlantic Records, the album marks Ros\u00e9's first solo release after departing from YG Entertainment and Interscope Records in 2023. Ros\u00e9 wrote and co-produced Rosie with a range of collaborators, including Bruno Mars, Carter Lang, and Omer Fedi. It was conceived as a 12-track pop album exploring pop-punk and alternative pop styles, whilst blending elements of 1990s R&B, synthpop, and ballads. The subject matter explores fame and heartbreak in Ros\u00e9's early twenties.\nThree singles supported the album. \"Apt.\", a collaboration between Ros\u00e9 and Mars, was released as the album's lead single on 18 October 2024. It reached number one on the Billboard Global 200 and topped the charts in various territories, including South Korea, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. It was followed by the singles \"Number One Girl\" and \"Toxic Till the End\". Upon release, Rosie debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, becoming the highest-ranked album by a K-pop female soloist on the chart. It also entered the top ten in countries such as Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Rosie received generally favourable reviews from critics, with most critics praising the album for its perceived emotional depth, strong songwriting, and versatile pop sound.",
