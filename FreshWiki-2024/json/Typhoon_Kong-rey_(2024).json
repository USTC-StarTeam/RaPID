  "summary": "Typhoon Kong-rey, known in the Philippines as  Super Typhoon Leon, was a powerful and large tropical cyclone that impacted Taiwan and the Philippines before later affecting East China, South Korea, and Japan in late October and early November 2024. Kong-rey was the first typhoon in Taiwan's history to make landfall after mid-October and the largest storm to strike since Typhoon Herb in 1996. Additionally, it was the second tropical cyclone in a series to impact the Philippines, following Tropical Storm Trami a few days earlier, and preceding Typhoons Yinxing, Toraji, Usagi, and Man-yi which would impact a few days later.\nThe twenty-first named storm and the third super typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Kong-rey developed from a weak exposed low-level circulation located west-northwest of Guam. On October 25, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a tropical storm named Kong-rey, and on October 28, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as a minimal typhoon before the JMA followed suit. On October 30, the JTWC reported that the system had peaked as a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon, with 1-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph). The JMA noted that Kong-rey reached its maximum strength with 10-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) and a central pressure of 925 hPa (27.32 inHg). After reaching its peak intensity, Kong-rey began an eyewall replacement cycle, and satellite imagery showed a large eye and rapidly rotating features along the inner edge of the eyewall. The following day, Kong-rey completed the eyewall replacement cycle as it approached Taiwan from the southeast, and passed close to Batanes and the Orchid Island before making landfall in Chenggong, Taitung. It was later reemerged over the Taiwan Strait with a weakened convective structure, and its rapid movement across Taiwan may be attributed to a lee-side jump. It moved along the eastern coast of China as it interacted with a strong frontal system while beginning its extratropical transition. By November 1, the JMA reported that Kong-rey had transitioned into an extratropical low as it moved north-northeastward along the northwestern periphery of a mid-level subtropical high, quickly developing frontal characteristics with a weak cold front extending south from the center and a warm front extending east-northeastward. The extratropical storm crossed into Japan the next day and then emerged into the Pacific Ocean. Its remnants were last noted by the JMA on November 4 near the International Dateline; however, the Ocean Prediction Center reported that these remnants crossed the Central North Pacific Ocean, and were gradually moving toward the Alaskan coast. On November 7, Kong-rey's remnants were absorbed into another extratropical cyclone just south of Southwest Alaska.\nAuthorities advised evacuations in Batangas, which was devastated by Tropical Storm Trami the previous week. In Taiwan, classes were suspended in Taitung County, and multiple flights and trips were also canceled. Heavy rain advisories were issued by the Central Weather Administration, with torrential rain warnings in Yilan County and Hualien County. In East China, Kong-rey brought strong winds and heavy rains to the provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian, while on Jeju Island, South Korea, Hallasan recorded up to 268.5 mm (10.57 in) of rain, resulting in flooding that damaged buildings across the island. The JMA reported that warm, moist air from the storm was bringing heavy rainfall and thunderstorms to western Japan. Overall, Kong-rey was responsible for three deaths and 690 injuries, causing approximately $167 million (2024 USD) in damages.",
