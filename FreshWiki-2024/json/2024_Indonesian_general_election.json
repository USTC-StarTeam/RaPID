  "summary": "General elections were held in Indonesia on 14 February 2024 to elect the president, vice president, and People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), which consists of the House of Representatives (DPR), the Regional Representative Council (DPD), and members of local legislative bodies (DPRD) at the provincial and city or regency levels. The newly elected members of the MPR was sworn in on 1 October 2024, while the elected president and vice president was sworn in on 20 October 2024. Incumbent President Joko Widodo was ineligible to run for a third term due to limitations established by the Indonesian constitution. \nThe election had over 204 million eligible voters voting in over 800,000 polling stations across the country on the same date. Three presidential candidates contested the election: defense minister and retired Army General Prabowo Subianto, running with the Mayor of Surakarta Gibran Rakabuming Raka, former Governor of Jakarta Anies Baswedan, running with House Deputy Speaker Muhaimin Iskandar, and former Governor of Central Java Ganjar Pranowo running with Political, Legal, and Security Coordinating Minister Mahfud MD. The legislative election saw 24 contesting parties \u2013 including six exclusively in Aceh \u2013 field over 250,000 candidates contesting over 20,000 seats.\nIn the presidential elections, Prabowo received a majority of the vote in the first round, requiring no runoffs. Prabowo's 96.2 million votes were the highest received by any candidate in a democratic election in Indonesia, surpassing Joko Widodo's 85.6 million votes won in the 2019 election. In the legislative elections, eight parties qualified for the national legislature, with the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) remaining the largest party in the House of Representatives despite losing seats. Golkar gained the most seats, while the United Development Party (PPP) lost national parliamentary representation for the first time in its history as it fell short of the 4% parliamentary threshold.",
