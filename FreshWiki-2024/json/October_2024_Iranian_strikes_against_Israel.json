  "summary": "On 1 October 2024, Iran launched about 200 ballistic missiles at targets in Israel, in at least two waves, the largest attack during the ongoing Iran\u2013Israel conflict. Iran's codename for the attack was Operation True Promise 2 (Persian: \u0639\u0645\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0639\u062f\u0647 \u0635\u0627\u062f\u0642 \u06f2). It was the second direct attack by Iran against Israel, the first being the April 2024 strikes.\nIran claimed that the attack was an act of \"self-defense\" in retaliation for Israel's assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, and IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan. The attacks, while more successful at saturating Israeli air defenses than in April, did not appear to cause extensive damage. Israel said it had shot down most of the missiles and there had been no harm to its Air Force's capabilities. The US Navy and Jordan also reported intercepting missiles. The two fatalities caused by the attacks were a Palestinian man killed directly by missile debris and an Israeli man indirectly. Four Palestinians, two Israelis and two Jordanians sustained minor injuries. \nThe area of the Nevatim Airbase in the Negev was hit by 20 to 32 missiles, which damaged a hangar and taxiway. Several other missiles hit the Tel Nof Airbase, a school in the nearby town of Gedera, and an area north of Tel Aviv around the headquarters of the Israeli intelligence services Mossad and Unit 8200, damaging homes and a restaurant. Israeli media were barred from publishing the exact locations of impacts. Analysts suggested that Israel had deprioritized protecting Nevatim since \"the cost of repairing a damaged hangar or runway is far lower than the cost of using an Arrow interceptor.\" Iran used the Fattah-1 and Kheibar Shekan.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a \"big mistake\" and vowed that Iran \"will pay\" for it. The US promised \"severe consequences\" and pledged to work with Israel to ensure Iran faces repercussions for its actions. Iran claimed the targets it attacked were those involved in the Israel\u2013Hamas war.",
