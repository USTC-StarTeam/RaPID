  "summary": "The second season of the South Korean dystopian survival thriller television series Squid Game, marketed as Squid Game 2, is created by Korean television producer and writer Hwang Dong-hyuk. It was released on Netflix on December 26, 2024. \nThe season stars Lee Jung-jae, Lee Byung-hun, Im Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Wi Ha-joon, Park Gyu-young, Lee Jin-wook, Park Sung-hoon, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-shim, and Jo Yu-ri. It is set three years after Seong Gi-hun won the Squid Game, giving up on going to the United States and returning to the games with the intent of stopping them once and for all. He once again dives into the mysterious survival game, starting another life-or-death game with new participants gathered to win the prize of \u20a945.6 billion. A side-plot of the season sees Hwang Jun-ho trying to locate Gi-hun with help from hired mercenaries. \nWithin the first three days of release, the second season had 68 million views, exceeding the highest premiere viewership for Netflix held by the first season of Wednesday at 50.1 million views during its premiere week. According to Netflix, the season ranked at No. 1 in 92 countries. The season garnered positive reviews from critics, though it was generally deemed inferior to the first season. The third and final season, which was filmed back-to-back with the second season, will be released in 2025.",
