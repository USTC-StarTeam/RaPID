  "summary": "Snap legislative elections were held on 10 March 2024 to elect members of the Assembly of the Republic to the 16th Legislature of Portugal. All 230 seats to the Assembly of the Republic were up for election. The elections were called in November 2023 after Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa's resignation following an investigation around alleged corruption involving the award of contracts for lithium and hydrogen businesses.\nNo party achieved an absolute majority of seats, with the centre-right Democratic Alliance (AD) led by Lu\u00eds Montenegro winning 80 seats, closely followed by the Socialist Party (PS), which lost the absolute majority it had gained in the 2022 elections, and was reduced to 78 seats. The election also saw the surge of the right-wing populist Chega party as the third-largest party in parliament, more than quadrupling its previous seat count to 50 seats. Turnout in the election was at 59.9 percent, the highest since 2005, and in Portugal alone, turnout rose to 66.2%, the highest rate since 1995.\nThe leader of the largest party, Lu\u00eds Montenegro, would go on to form a centre-right minority government ending nearly a decade of rule by the Socialist Party.",
