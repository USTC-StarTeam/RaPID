  "summary": "The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Gr\u00e2ce) is the twelfth studio album by the American rapper Eminem. It was released through Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records on July 12, 2024. The concept album centers around a battle between Eminem himself and his Slim Shady alter ego. The album incorporates hardcore hip-hop, satirical hip-hop, and conscious hip-hop. The album features guest appearances from White Gold, Sly Pyper, JID, Dem Jointz, Ez Mil, Skylar Grey, Big Sean, BabyTron, and Jelly Roll; the Expanded Mourner's Edition additionally features 2 Chainz, Westside Boogie and Grip. \nProduction on the album was primarily handled by Eminem, alongside Dem Jointz, Fredwreck, Cubeatz, and Cole Bennett, as well as frequent collaborators Dr. Dre, Mr. Porter, and Luis Resto, among others. It follows his 2020 album, Music to Be Murdered By. The album was promoted by three singles: \"Houdini\", \"Tobey\", and \"Somebody Save Me\"; an additional music video was made for \"Temporary\". It was met with mixed reviews from critics, with Yahoo! News reporting that it holds the lowest Metacritic score of any Eminem album. Critics praised Eminem's rapping techniques while panning the lyrics. It topped the album charts in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The album serves as the rapper's eighth nomination at the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album on its 67th edition, after winning several times in 2000 (The Slim Shady LP), 2001 (The Marshall Mathers LP), 2003 (The Eminem Show), 2010 (Relapse), 2011 (Recovery) and 2015 (The Marshall Mathers LP 2).",
