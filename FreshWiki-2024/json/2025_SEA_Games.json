The event is scheduled to take place from 9 to 20 December 2025 across the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, as well as the provinces of Chonburi and Songkhla, Thailand.\nThe joint bid from the three provinces was awarded the Games on 13 January 2023, after Thailand was confirmed as the host country by the Southeast Asian Games Federation (SEAGF). This marks the first time that host cities were selected through a new bidding and election process for the SEA Games.\nThe 2025 SEA Games will be the seventh time Thailand has hosted the event, with Bangkok having previously hosted in 1959, 1967, 1975, and 1985. It will also be the first time Chonburi and Songkhla have served as the main host cities.",
