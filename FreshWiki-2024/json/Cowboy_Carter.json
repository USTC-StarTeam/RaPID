  "summary": "Cowboy Carter (also referred to as Act II: Cowboy Carter) is the eighth studio album by American singer and songwriter Beyonc\u00e9, released on March 29, 2024, via Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records. A concept album, Cowboy Carter is the second of a planned trilogy of albums, following Renaissance (2022). Beyonc\u00e9 conceived Cowboy Carter as a journey through a reinvention of Americana, spotlighting the overlooked contributions of Black pioneers to American musical and cultural history.\nMostly labeled a country and Americana album, Cowboy Carter blends together diverse Southern sub-genres that Beyonc\u00e9 listened to when growing up in Texas, including zydeco, rock and roll, folk, rhythm and blues, pop, psychedelic soul, hip-hop and bluegrass. Conceptually, the album is presented as a radio broadcast, with country singers Dolly Parton, Linda Martell, and Willie Nelson acting as disc jockeys. The album's songs feature rising Black country artists such as Shaboozey, Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, Reyna Roberts, and Willie Jones. The music is driven by a range of acoustic instruments played by musicians including Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Nile Rodgers, Jon Batiste, and Rhiannon Giddens.\nCowboy Carter was met with universal acclaim and appeared on multiple year-end lists; critics felt that the album's genre experimentation, expansive scope, and eclectic references aided an ambitious reimagining of Americana and country through the lens of their Black roots. The album increased the listenership of country music, drove cultural conversations on Black musicians' place within the genre, boosted the careers of rising country artists, and increased the popularity of Western wear and culture. At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, Cowboy Carter earned eleven nominations (including Album of the Year and Best Country Album), making it the third-most nominated album in Grammy history.\nCowboy Carter debuted at number one in several countries and broke certain chart and streaming records. In the United States, Cowboy Carter became Beyonc\u00e9's eighth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200 and the first album by a black woman to top the Top Country Albums chart. The album was supported three singles, \"Texas Hold 'Em\", \"16 Carriages\" and \"II Most Wanted\", with the first becoming Beyonc\u00e9's ninth U.S. number-one single and the first country song by a Black woman to top the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts.",
