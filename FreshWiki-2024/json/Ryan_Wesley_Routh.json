  "summary": "Ryan Wesley Routh (born February 18, 1966) is an American man who allegedly attempted to assassinate 45th & 47th U.S. President and the presumptive Republican Party nominee for the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump, who went on to win the elections just 2 months later.Routh's motives are currently under investigation.\nOn September 15, 2024, a Secret Service agent shot at least four rounds at Routh, who was hiding with an SKS-style rifle in shrubbery at the Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach. He was allegedly pointing his weapon through the fence line of the golf course, 300\u2013500 yards away from Trump, who was moving between holes five and six alongside Republican megadonor and real estate investor Steve Witkoff. Routh fled the scene, but was later arrested as the prime suspect. An update given by the FBI on September 16 mentioned that Routh had not fired his weapon.\nRouth has pleaded not guilty to five federal charges, including attempting to assassinate a presidential candidate. His trial is scheduled to begin on September 8, 2025. Routh could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.",
