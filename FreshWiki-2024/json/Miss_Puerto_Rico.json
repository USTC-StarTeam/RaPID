  "summary": "Miss Puerto Rico is a national title bestowed on the women representing Puerto Rico in international beauty pageants.\nIn 1987, Puerto Rico became the ninth nation to win the Big Three pageants of Miss Universe, Miss World, and Miss International. In 2019, Puerto Rico won Miss Earth, becoming the fourth nation to win the Big Four pageants. Having also won Miss Supranational, Miss Grand International, and Miss Intercontinental by 2019, Puerto Rico became the first nation\u2014and only one as of 23 January 2025\u2014to win the Big Six or Grand Slam and the Big Seven pageants. \nAs the second Ibero-American nation with the most titles in the Big Three, Big Four, Grand Slam, and Big Seven pageants, the fourth nation globally with the most titles in the Big Three, Big Four, and Big Seven, and the fifth nation globally in the Grand Slam, Puerto Rico, which has won 17 major titles as of 23 January 2025, is considered a powerhouse in beauty pageants, alongside Venezuela, United States, Philippines, and India.\nIn Puerto Rico, beauty queens are an important part of the culture. The businesswoman in the modeling and beauty industry in charge of many Puerto Rican representatives in international pageants between 1952 and 1998, Anna Santisteban, popularly known as the Hacedora de Reinas (Maker of Queens), is recognized as the figure who established the fervent enthusiasm for beauty queens in Puerto Rico. As the holder of the Miss Universe franchise in Puerto Rico, Santisteban produced three international winners, in 1970, 1985 and 1993.\nDespite being a self-governed unincorporated U.S. territory with the title of commonwealth (Spanish: estado libre asociado, lit.\u2009'free associated state'), Puerto Rico competes in international beauty competitions as a separate and independent nation from the United States since 1952, as it does in the Olympic Games since 1948 and the Pan American Games since 1955.",
