  "summary": "Madame Web is a 2024 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is the fourth film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) and stars Dakota Johnson in the title role, alongside Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor, Tahar Rahim, Mike Epps, Emma Roberts, and Adam Scott. The film was directed by S. J. Clarkson from a screenplay she wrote with Claire Parker, Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. The film depicts the origin story of Cassie Webb (Johnson), who confronts her past while trying to save three young women (Sweeney, Merced, O'Connor) from Ezekiel Sims (Rahim), who wants to kill them before they become Spider-Women in the future and kill him.\nSony Pictures began developing a Madame Web film for its shared universe by September 2019, with Sazama and Sharpless writing the script. Clarkson joined as the director in May 2020, in her feature film directorial debut, and Johnson was cast in early 2022. Further castings occurred in the following months, particularly for the Spider-Women characters. Filming began in mid-July 2022 and wrapped before the end of the year, occurring throughout Massachusetts, New York City, and Mexico. Clarkson and Parker's involvement as writers was revealed in November 2023. Johan S\u00f6derqvist, a frequent collaborator of Clarkson, composed the film's score.\nMadame Web premiered at the Regency Village Theatre in Westwood, Los Angeles, on February 12, 2024, and was released in the United States two days later by Columbia Pictures (via Sony Pictures Releasing). The film was panned by critics and was a box-office bomb, grossing $100.5 million worldwide against a budget of $80\u2013100 million.",
