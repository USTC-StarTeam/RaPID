  "summary": "\"Houdini\" is a song by American rapper Eminem, and is the lead single from his twelfth studio album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Gr\u00e2ce). The song was produced by Eminem and Luis Resto, and was released through Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records on May 31, 2024. It interpolates multiple previous Eminem works, as well as \"Abracadabra\" by the Steve Miller Band; Jeff Bass, Anne Dudley, Steve Miller, Trevor Horn, DJ Head, and Malcolm McLaren are credited as songwriters due to the interpolation of the latter.\nReleased alongside an accompanying music video, \"Houdini\" debuted at the top of the Billboard Global 200. It also topped the charts in Australia, Austria, Canada, Iceland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and has reached the top ten of the charts in Belgium, Czechia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden, and the United States.",
