  "summary": "Kiddush levana, also known as Birkat halevana, is a Jewish ritual and prayer service, generally observed on the first or second Saturday night of each Hebrew month. The service includes a blessing to God for the appearance of the new moon, readings from Scripture and the Talmud, and other liturgy depending on custom. In most communities, ritual elements include the shalom aleikhem greeting and jumping toward the moon, with some communities also incorporating kabbalistic practices. According to Marcia Falk, \"There is, arguably, no more colorful and intriguing piece of liturgy in Jewish culture than Birkat halevana\".\nThe oldest part of the ritual, the blessing, is described by the Talmud. Other elements were introduced by Massechet Soferim in the 8th century, although their ultimate origin is obscure. In the years since, different Jewish communities have incorporated various quotations from the Bible and Talmud, liturgical compositions, and mystical customs into their version of the ritual.\nSince the 15th century, Kiddush levana has been \"a highly visible target for rationalist critiques, both Jewish and non-Jewish\". Generations of the Authorised Daily Prayer Book expurgated all ritual elements, and some other 20th-century prayerbooks ignored it entirely. By the 1970s, it was widely described as defunct, although Martin Lockshin claimed this was only true among non-Orthodox Jews. In 1992, Chabad announced a campaign to popularize its observance.\nAs of 2024, it is included in all mainstream Orthodox prayerbooks, including recent editions of the Authorised Daily Prayer Book. It is observed by some within Conservative Judaism, Reform Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism, and Jewish Renewal. Among the Orthodox, it is almost exclusively reserved for men, but non-Orthodox Kiddush levana may involve men, women, or both. The ritual continues to evolve.",
