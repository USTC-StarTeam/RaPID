  "summary": "Nicole Brown Simpson (n\u00e9e Brown; May 19, 1959 \u2013 June 12, 1994) was the second wife of American professional football player, actor, and media personality O. J. Simpson. She was murdered outside her Brentwood home, along with her friend Ron Goldman, in 1994.\nBrown met Simpson in 1977 and they married in 1985, five years after Simpson had retired from professional American football. Their marriage lasted eight years and they had a daughter and a son. Reports suggest that Simpson emotionally, verbally, and physically abused Brown throughout their relationship, which continued after their divorce. Brown and Simpson made an attempt at reconciliation, but later broke up again, seemingly permanently, in May 1994.\nIn June 1994, Brown and Goldman were stabbed to death, and Simpson was tried for the murders. Following a highly publicized criminal trial, Simpson was acquitted of all charges, though he was later found liable of the wrongful deaths in a civil lawsuit in 1997. No other suspects have ever been identified, and the killings remain unsolved, although Brown's family have expressed the belief that Simpson committed the murders and was the sole perpetrator.",
