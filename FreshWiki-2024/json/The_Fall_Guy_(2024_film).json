  "summary": "The Fall Guy is a 2024 American action comedy film directed by David Leitch and written by Drew Pearce, loosely based on the 1980s TV series. The plot follows a stuntman (Ryan Gosling) working on his ex-girlfriend's (Emily Blunt) directorial debut action film, only to find himself involved in a conspiracy surrounding the film's lead actor (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). The cast also features Hannah Waddingham, Teresa Palmer, Stephanie Hsu, and Winston Duke.\nThe Fall Guy premiered at SXSW on March 12, 2024, and was released in the United States on May 3 by Universal Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, but underperformed at the box office, grossing $181 million worldwide against a $125\u2013150 million production budget and losing the studio around $50 million.",
