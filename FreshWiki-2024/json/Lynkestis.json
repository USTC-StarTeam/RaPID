  "summary": "Lynkestis, Lyncestis, Lyngistis, Lynkos or Lyncus (Ancient Greek: \u039b\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c2 or \u039b\u03cd\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 Latin: Lyncestis or Lyncus) was a region and principality traditionally located in Upper Macedonia. It was the northernmost mountainous region of Upper Macedonia, located east of the Prespa Lakes.\nIn its earlier history, Lynkestis was an independent polity ruled by a local dynasty which claimed descent from the Bacchiadae, a Greek aristocratic family from ancient Corinth. They were ruled by a basileus, as did the rest of the tribes in Lower and Upper Macedonia. The few existing primary sources show that before the rise of Macedon it maintained connections with the Illyrians and was frequently in hostilities with the Argeads.\nThe inhabitants of Lynkestis were known as Lyncestae or Lynkestai (Greek: \u039b\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u1fc6\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9). Hecataeus (6th century BC) included them among the Molossians, while Thucydides (5th century BC) considered them Macedonians. Most later ancient authors considered them Macedonians, while others included them among the Illyrians. Modern scholars regard them as either Macedonians, Epirotes (Molossians) or Illyrians. Some generally consider them to be Greeks of Upper Macedonia.\nIn the second half of the 5th century BC Lynkestis was the strongest tribal state in Upper Macedonia under king Arrhabaeus, son of Bomerus. During the Peloponnesian War the combined army of Lyncestians under king Arrhabaeus and Illyrians won against the joined forces of the Macedonian king Perdiccas II and the Spartan leader Brasidas at the Battle of Lyncestis in 423 BC.\nLynkestis was annexed or retained by the Illyrian king Bardylis after his victory against Perdiccas III of Macedon in 360 BC. At the Battle of Erigon Valley in 358 BC, the Illyrians under Bardylis were defeated by Phillip II and Lynkestis became part of Macedon. After his conquest, Philip founded Heraclea Lyncestis, which would become the main city of the area in antiquity. Although they became part of Macedon, Lynkestians retained their own basileus.\nAccording to Hammond, the locals were recruited by Philip II to serve in the king\u2019s army due to their common language as well as because they were accorded equal terms with the population of Lower Macedonia. Later they contributed to the Indian campaign led by Alexander the Great.",
