  "summary": "The Substance is a 2024 body horror film written, directed, co-edited, and co-produced by Coralie Fargeat. It follows a fading celebrity, Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore) who, after being fired by her producer (Dennis Quaid) due to her age, uses a black market drug that creates a much younger version of herself (Margaret Qualley) with unexpected side effects.\nAn international co-production between France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the film followed the critical success of Fargeat's first feature film, Revenge. Motivated by societal pressures on women's bodies and aging, she wrote the screenplay in two years with detailed descriptions and minimal dialogue. Moore was cast in the leading role after a series of interviews, Qualley was cast second, and Ray Liotta was originally cast in Quaid's role prior to his death. Filmed in France over 108 days, the film made extensive use of prosthetic makeup designed by Pierre-Olivier Persin, insert shots, a variety of sets, and approximately 21,000 liters of fake blood. The film score was written by Raffertie and also features \"Pump It Up!\" covered by DJ Endor. The prosthetic design included a series of grotesque and hyperrealistic suits, puppets, and dummies for Elisabeth's drug-induced transformation.\nThe Substance had its world premiere on May 19, 2024 at the 77th Cannes Film Festival main competition, where Fargeat won Best Screenplay. It was released theatrically in the United Kingdom and the United States by Mubi on September 20, 2024, and in France by Metropolitan Filmexport on November 6, 2024. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $76.5 million and becoming Mubi's highest-grossing film. The film received numerous accolades, including five nominations at the 82nd Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy for Moore, seven nominations at the 30th Critics' Choice Awards including Best Picture, five nominations at the 78th British Academy Film Awards, and a Best Actress nomination for Moore at the 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards.",
