  "summary": "The Greatest of All Time (also marketed as GOAT) is a 2024 Indian Tamil-language spy action thriller film directed by Venkat Prabhu and produced by AGS Entertainment. The film stars Vijay in four roles, alongside Prashanth, Prabhu Deva, Mohan, Jayaram, Ajmal Ameer, Vaibhav, Yogi Babu, Premgi Amaren, Sneha, Laila, Meenakshi Chaudhary and Abyukta Manikandan. It is the twenty-fifth production of the studio and the penultimate film of Vijay before his political entry. The film follows Gandhi, the former leader of an anti-terrorism squad, who reunites with his squad members to address the problems which were stemmed from their previous actions.\nThe film was officially announced in May 2023 under the tentative title Thalapathy 68, as it is Vijay's 68th film as a leading actor, and the official title was announced that December. Principal photography commenced in October 2023 and wrapped by late June 2024. Filming locations included Chennai, Thailand, Hyderabad, Sri Lanka, Pondicherry, Thiruvananthapuram, Russia and United States. The film has music composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, cinematography handled by Siddhartha Nuni and editing by Venkat Raajen.\nThe Greatest of All Time was released worldwide on 5 September 2024 in standard and IMAX formats to mixed reviews from critics, who praised Vijay's performance, action sequences and climax while the lack of character development and writing received criticism. The film grossed \u20b9440\u2013455.63 crore at the box office, against a budget of \u20b9380\u2013400 crore, which is AGS's highest expense and ranks among the most expensive Indian films and is also one of the priciest non-English-language films ever made, emerging as the highest-grossing Tamil film of 2024, the fourth highest-grossing Indian film of 2024, fifth highest-grossing Tamil film of all time, fifth highest-grossing Tamil film in overseas, and the third highest-grossing film in Tamil Nadu.",
