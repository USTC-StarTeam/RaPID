  "summary": "Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez G\u00f3mez  (28 August 1921 \u2013 21 November 2007), better known as Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, was a Spanish actor, screenwriter, film director, theater director, novelist, and playwright. Prolific and outstanding in all these fields, he was elected member of the Royal Spanish Academy in 1998. He was born in Lima, Peru while his mother, Spanish actress Carola Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez, was making a tour in Latin America. He would later use her surname for his stage name when he moved to Spain in 1924.\nFern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez was regarded as one of Spain's most beloved and respected entertainers, winning two Silver Bears for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival for The Anchorite and Stico. He was also the recipient of the Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts, the National Theater Award, the Gold Medal of Merit in the Fine Arts, the Gold Medal of the Spanish Film Academy, and six Goya Awards. He starred in 200 films between 1943 and 2006, working with directors including Carlos Saura (Ana and the Wolves, Mama Turns 100), V\u00edctor Erice (The Spirit of the Beehive), Fernando Trueba (Belle \u00c9poque), Jos\u00e9 Luis Garci (The Grandfather),  Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuerda (Butterfly's Tongue) and Pedro Almod\u00f3var (All About My Mother).\nHe directed over 25 films, among them El extra\u00f1o viaje (1964),  and Life Goes On (1965), both great classics of the Spanish cinema that were very limited distribution due to Franco's censorship and made him a \"cursed\" filmmaker in his country. His film Voyage to Nowhere (1986) earned critical acclaim, becoming the most awarded Spanish film at the 1st Goya Awards ceremony.",
