  "summary": "The 2023\u201324 Australian region cyclone season was the fifth consecutive season to have below-average activity in terms of named storms. Despite this, it was the second in a row to have at least five severe tropical cyclones, including Australia's wettest tropical cyclone on record. The season officially started on 1 November 2023 and ended on 30 April 2024, however, a tropical cyclone could form at any time between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024 and would count towards the season total. During the season, tropical cyclones were officially monitored by one of the three tropical cyclone warning centres (TCWCs) for the region which are operated by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, National Weather Service of Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and other national meteorological services including M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France and the Fiji Meteorological Service will also monitor the basin during the season.",
