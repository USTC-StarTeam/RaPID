  "summary": "The second and current tenure of Donald Trump as the president of the United States began on January 20, 2025, when he was inaugurated as the 47th president. Trump, who previously served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021, took office following his victory over Democratic incumbent vice president Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. He is the second president in U.S. history to serve nonconsecutive terms after Grover Cleveland in 1893 and is the oldest individual to assume the presidency. Following his victories in the 2016 and 2024 elections, he is not eligible for a third term according to the 22nd Amendment.",
