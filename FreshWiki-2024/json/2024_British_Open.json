  "summary": "The 2024 British Open (officially the 2024 Unibet British Open) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 23 to 29 September 2024 at the Centaur in Cheltenham, England. Qualifying (round 1) took place from 31 July to 3 August 2024 at the Leicester Arena in Leicester. The fifth ranking tournament of the 2024\u200d\u2013\u200d25 season, it followed the 2024 English Open and preceded the 2024 Wuhan Open. It was organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by online gambling platform Unibet. The winner received \u00a3100,000 from a total prize fund of \u00a3502,000 and the Clive Everton Trophy. Everton died on 27 September, two days before the tournament concluded.\nThe defending champion was Mark Williams, who defeated Mark Selby 10\u200d\u2013\u200d7 in the 2023 final, but he lost 1\u200d\u2013\u200d4 to Rory Thor in qualifying (round 1). Selby won the tournament, beating John Higgins 10\u200d\u2013\u200d5 in the final to capture his first British Open title and the 23rd ranking title of his career. The event produced 55 century breaks, 12 in qualifying and 43 in the main stage; the highest was a maximum break by Mark Allen in his third\u2011round match against Ben Mertens. Judd Trump made his 1,000th century break in professional competition during his quarter-final match against Allen, becoming the third player to reach that milestone, after Ronnie O'Sullivan and John Higgins.",
