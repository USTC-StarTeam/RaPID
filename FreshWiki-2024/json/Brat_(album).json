  "summary": "Brat is the sixth studio album by English singer Charli XCX, released through Atlantic Records on 7 June 2024. It features production by Charli XCX, her longtime executive producer A. G. Cook, Finn Keane, Cirkut, her partner George Daniel, and others. The album draws influence from the 2000s English rave music scene, with a more aggressive club sound than her previous album, Crash (2022).\nCommercially, Brat peaked at number one in the UK, Australia, and Ireland, and reached the top ten in 12 other countries, including the United States, where it marked Charli XCX's highest debut on the Billboard 200 (number three). A deluxe edition, Brat and It's the Same but There's Three More Songs So It's Not, with three additional tracks was released on 10 June 2024. A remix album, titled Brat and It's Completely Different but Also Still Brat, featuring 20 guest artists, was released on 11 October 2024.\nAccording to Metacritic, which compiles scores from music critics, Brat is the highest-rated album of 2024 and the 16th-highest-rated album of all time. The album was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize for 2024 Album of the Year. The cover art and aesthetic became a popular Internet trend, and was adopted by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign after Charli XCX tweeted about the candidate. Brat was nominated for nine Grammy Awards at the 67th annual ceremony, including Album of the Year. To support the album, Charli XCX embarked on the Sweat tour in 2024 with collaborator Troye Sivan, and an additional Brat solo tour coming in late 2024 and early 2025.",
