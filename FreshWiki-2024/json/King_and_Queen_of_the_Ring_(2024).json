  "summary": "The 2024 King and Queen of the Ring was a professional wrestling event produced by the American company WWE. It was the 12th King of the Ring event, but under a new name, and took place on Saturday, May 25, 2024, at the Jeddah Super Dome in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. It aired via pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming and featured wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event hosted the finals of both the 23rd King of the Ring tournament and the second Queen of the Ring tournament, with the last tournaments for each held in 2021.\nThis was the 11th event that WWE held in Saudi Arabia under a 10-year partnership in support of Saudi Vision 2030, thus marking the first King of the Ring event held outside of the United States. The event was originally scheduled to be held at the same location in May 2023, but plans were changed and it was replaced by Night of Champions. This was the first King of the Ring event since 2015, which was livestreamed exclusively on the WWE Network, the first to livestream on Peacock in the United States, the first to air on traditional PPV since 2002, and the first dedicated event for the Queen of the Ring tournament, which was originally established in 2021 as the Queen's Crown tournament. For the 2024 event, winners of each tournament received a world championship match at SummerSlam.\nSix matches were contested at the event, including one on the Countdown to King and Queen of the Ring pre-show. In the main event, Cody Rhodes defeated Logan Paul to retain SmackDown's Undisputed WWE Championship. In other prominent matches, Raw's Gunther defeated SmackDown's Randy Orton to win the King of the Ring tournament, earning a match for his brand's World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, SmackDown's Nia Jax defeated Raw's Lyra Valkyria to win the Queen of the Ring tournament, earning a match for her brand's WWE Women's Championship at SummerSlam, and in the opening bout, Liv Morgan defeated Becky Lynch to win Raw's Women's World Championship.",
