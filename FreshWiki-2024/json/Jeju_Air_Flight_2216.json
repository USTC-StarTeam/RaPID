  "summary": "Jeju Air Flight 2216 was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Jeju Air from Suvarnabhumi Airport near Bangkok, Thailand, to Muan International Airport in Muan County, South Korea. On 29 December 2024, the Boeing 737-800 operating the flight was approaching Muan, when a bird strike occurred. The pilots issued a mayday alert, performed a go-around, and on the second landing attempt, the landing gear did not deploy and the airplane belly landed well beyond the normal touchdown zone. It overran the runway, colliding with multiple approach lighting system bulbs and crashed into a berm encasing a concrete structure that supported an antenna array for the instrument landing system. The collision killed all 175 passengers and 4 of 6 crew members. The surviving 2 cabin crew were seated in the rear of the plane, which detached from the fuselage, and were rescued with injuries.\nThe accident is the deadliest aviation disaster involving a South Korean airliner since the 1997 crash of Korean Air Flight 801 in Guam and became the deadliest aviation accident on South Korean soil, surpassing the 2002 crash of Air China Flight 129 that killed 129 people. This was the first fatal accident in Jeju Air's 19-year history.\nThe crash is the deadliest aviation accident involving a Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft and the deadliest aviation accident since the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in 2018.",
