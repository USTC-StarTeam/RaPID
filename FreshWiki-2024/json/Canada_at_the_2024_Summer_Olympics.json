  "summary": "Canada competed at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France from July 26 to August 11, 2024. Since Canada's debut in 1900, Canadian athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, except for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the country's support for the United States-led boycott.\nCanada's final team consisted of 315 (123 men and 192 women) athletes. On July 16, 2024 a final team of 316 athletes, along with 22 alternates, were confirmed by the Canadian Olympic Committee. Athletes from nine of the country's provinces and territories are represented on the team. The following day, decathlete Pierce LePage withdrew from the team due to injury, which brought the team to 315 athletes. On July 24, 2024, sprinter Andre De Grasse and weightlifter Maude Charron were named as the country's flagbearers for the opening ceremony. Meanwhile, on August 11, 2024 Olympic champion hammer thrower Ethan Katzberg and multiple time gold medalist Summer McIntosh were named as Canada's closing ceremony flagbearers.\nCanadian athletes won 27 medals (nine gold, seven silver and 11 bronze). This meant Canada finished 12th in the medal table, and 11th in overall medals won. The 27 medals won marked the country's second best-ever total medals result (after the boycotted 1984 Summer Olympics), surpassing the 24 medals won in 2020. The nine gold medals won was also the country's second best-ever total (after the boycotted 1984 Games).",
