  "summary": "Elimination Chamber: Perth (known as No Escape in Germany) was a 2024 professional wrestling event produced by the American company WWE. It was the 14th Elimination Chamber event and took place on Saturday, February 24, 2024, at Perth Stadium in Perth, Western Australia, Australia. The event aired on pay-per-view (PPV) and via livestreaming and was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. This was WWE's first event to be held in Australia since Super Show-Down in October 2018, and the company's only event in the Asia\u2013Pacific region in 2024. This was also the third consecutive Elimination Chamber to be held outside of the United States as well as the first to take place in an outdoor venue.\nThe event is based around the Elimination Chamber match, a type of multi-person elimination-based Steel Cage match in which championships or future opportunities at championships are at stake. The 2024 event featured two such matches, one each for the men and women with wrestlers from both brands in each, and the respective winners earned matches for the Raw brand's men's and women's world championships\u2014the World Heavyweight Championship and Women's World Championship\u2014at WrestleMania XL. The men's eponymous match was won by Raw's Drew McIntyre, while the women's, which was the opening bout, was won by Raw's Becky Lynch. Three other matches, including one on the pre-show, were also contested at the event. The main event was between two Australian natives where Rhea Ripley defeated Nia Jax to retain the Women's World Championship, which was the first time women main-evented a WWE main roster PPV and livestreaming event since WrestleMania 37 in April 2021.",
