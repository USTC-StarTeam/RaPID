  "summary": "The Kolkata Knight Riders-Royal Challengers Bangalore rivalry is a cricket rivalry between the IPL teams of Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the defunct Champions League Twenty20 (CLT20). It is the oldest rivalry of the IPL and is often referred to as the El Primero of the Indian Premier League. Both teams have faced each other 34 times in the IPL and  1 time in CLT20, with the Kolkata Knight Riders having more victories (21). Kolkata Knight Riders have 3 IPL titles, while Royal Challengers Bangalore have none.\nThe rivalry became more intense when, during the 2013 Indian Premier League faceoff between the two teams, Gautam Gambhir had a verbal spat with Virat Kohli when Kohli was sledged after being dismissed by Lakshmipathy Balaji. This incident increased the hype of the rivalry and is still constant despite the departure of Gambhir from the Knight Riders in 2018.\nThe highest run-scorer from this fixture is Virat Kohli (Royal Challengers Bangalore) with 962 runs, while the highest wicket-taker is Sunil Narine (Kolkata Knight Riders) with 26 wickets.",
