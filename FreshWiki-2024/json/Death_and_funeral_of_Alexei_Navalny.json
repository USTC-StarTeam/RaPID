  "summary": "On 16 February 2024, at 14:19 Moscow time (11:19 GMT), the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug announced that Russian opposition activist and political prisoner Alexei Navalny died while serving a 19-year prison sentence in corrective colony FKU IK-3, in the village of Kharp in the Russian Arctic. Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, confirmed his death the next day and demanded his body should be returned to his family as soon as possible. One report from Russia Today suggested the cause of death was a blood clot, but this diagnosis was disputed by Alexander Polupan, who had treated Navalny before. Navalny was 47 years old when he died.\nNavalny's death spurred numerous protests and gatherings in different countries, including Russia, where hundreds of mourners were detained. Western officials and Russian opposition activists held Russian authorities, including President Vladimir Putin, responsible for his death. US intelligence agencies later concluded that Putin likely did not order Navalny's death.\nNavalny's funeral was held in Moscow on 1 March 2024, at the Mother of God Soothe My Sorrows church in the Maryino District. He was buried in the Borisovskoye \u0441emetery in the Brateyevo District.",
