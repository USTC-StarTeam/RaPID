  "summary": "The 2024 Masters (officially the 2024 MrQ Masters) was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament that took place from 7 to 14 January 2024 at Alexandra Palace in London, England. The second Triple Crown event of the 2023\u200d\u2013\u200d24 season, following the 2023 UK Championship and preceding the 2024 World Championship, the tournament was the 50th edition of the Masters, which was first held in 1975. Organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by online casino MrQ, the tournament was broadcast by the BBC, Eurosport, and Discovery+ domestically, and by multiple other broadcasters internationally. The winner received \u00a3250,000 from a total prize pool of \u00a3725,000.\nThe top 16 players in the snooker world rankings, as they stood after the UK Championship, were invited to the event. Judd Trump was the defending champion, having defeated Mark Williams 10\u200d\u2013\u200d8 in the 2023 final, but he lost 5\u200d\u2013\u200d6 to Ali Carter in the quarter-finals. Ronnie O'Sullivan defeated Carter 10\u200d\u2013\u200d7 in the final to win a record-extending 8th Masters title and 23rd Triple Crown title. He became the oldest Masters winner, aged 48 years and 40 days, surpassing Stuart Bingham, who was 43 years and 243 days old when he won the 2020 event. O'Sullivan already held the record as the tournament's youngest winner\u2014set 29 years earlier at the 1995 event\u2014which gave him the distinction of simultaneously becoming the youngest and oldest Masters champion. \nThe tournament produced 27 century breaks, including two maximum breaks. Ding Junhui made the first maximum in his first-round match against O'Sullivan, and Mark Allen made the second in his quarter-final match against Mark Selby. These were respectively the fourth and fifth maximum breaks in the tournament's history. In his quarter-final match against Allen, Carter became the first player to make three consecutive century breaks at the Masters. Carter made a record nine centuries in the tournament, surpassing the previous record of eight set by O'Sullivan at the 2007 and 2009 events.",
