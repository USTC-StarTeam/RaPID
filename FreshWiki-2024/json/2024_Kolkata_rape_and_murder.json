  "summary": "On 9 August 2024, a 31-year-old female postgraduate trainee doctor at R. G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata, West Bengal, India, was raped and murdered in a college building. Her body was found in a seminar room on campus. On 10 August 2024, a 33-year-old male civic volunteer working for Kolkata Police was arrested under suspicion of committing the crime. Three days later, the Calcutta High Court, transferred the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) stating that the Kolkata Police's investigation did not inspire confidence. The junior doctors in West Bengal undertook a strike action for 42 days demanding a thorough probe of the incident and adequate security at hospitals. The incident amplified debate about the safety of women and doctors in India, and has sparked significant outrage, and nationwide and international protests.\nIn January 2025, the suspect, identified as Sanjay Roy, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.",
