  "summary": "Nosferatu is a 2024 American gothic horror film written and directed by Robert Eggers. It is a remake of the film Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922), itself an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula (1897). It stars Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Count Orlok, with Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp starring as Thomas and Ellen Hutter. The supporting cast includes Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Emma Corrin, Ralph Ineson, Simon McBurney, and Willem Dafoe.\nDevelopment began in 2015, when Eggers planned to make it his second film; he described it as a passion project, but eventually opted to delay its production. Skarsg\u00e5rd and Depp were cast in lead roles in September 2022. Filming took place primarily at Barrandov Studios in Prague between February and May 2023.\nNosferatu had its world premiere in Berlin on December 2, 2024. It was theatrically released in the United States by Focus Features and internationally by Universal Pictures on December 25, 2024. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $156.8 million worldwide on a $50 million budget, becoming Eggers' highest-grossing film.",
