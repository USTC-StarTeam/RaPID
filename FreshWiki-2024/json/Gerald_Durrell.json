  "summary": "Gerald Malcolm Durrell OBE (7 January 1925 \u2013 30 January 1995) was an Indian-born British naturalist, writer, zookeeper, conservationist, and television presenter. He was born in Jamshedpur in British India, and moved to England when his father died in 1928.  In 1935 the family moved to Corfu, and stayed there for four years, before the outbreak of World War II forced them to return to the UK.  In 1946 he received an inheritance from his father's will that he used to fund animal-collecting trips to the British Cameroons and British Guiana. He married Jacquie Rasen in 1951; they had very little money, and she persuaded him to write an account of his first trip to the Cameroons.  The result, titled The Overloaded Ark, sold well, and he began writing accounts of his other trips.  An expedition to Argentina and Paraguay followed in 1953, and three years later he published My Family and Other Animals, an account of his years in Corfu.  It became a bestseller.\nIn the late 1950s Durrell decided to found his own zoo.  He visited the Cameroons for the third time, and on his return attempted to persuade Bournemouth and Poole town councils to start local zoos.  These plans came to nothing but he finally found a suitable site on the island of Jersey, and leased the property in late 1959.  He envisaged the Jersey Zoo as an institution for the study of animals and for captive breeding, rather than a showcase for the public.  In 1963 control of the zoo was turned over to the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust.  The zoo repeatedly came close to bankruptcy over the next few years, and Durrell raised money for it by his writing and by fundraising appeals.  The site for the zoo was leased, and to guarantee the zoo's future, Durrell launched a successful appeal in 1970 for funds to purchase the property.  He wrote about his further expeditions, and the zoo, and his own experiences in Corfu and after the war.\nDurrell was an alcoholic and had repeated problems caused by his drinking.  In 1976 he separated from his wife; they were divorced in 1979, and Durrell remarried, to Lee McGeorge, an American zoologist.  He and Lee made several television documentaries in the 1980s, including Durrell in Russia and Ark on the Move. They co-authored The Amateur Naturalist, which was intended for amateurs who wanted to know more about the natural history of the world around them, though it also had sections about each of the world's major ecosystems. This book became his most successful, selling well over a million copies; a television series was made from it.\nDurrell became an OBE in 1982.  In 1984 he founded the Durrell Conservation Academy, to train conservationists in captive breeding.  The institution has been very influential: its thousands of graduates included a director of London Zoo, an organisation which was once opposed to Durrell's work. He was diagnosed with liver cancer and cirrhosis in 1994, and received a liver transplant, but died the following January.  He was cremated, and his ashes were buried at Jersey Zoo.",
