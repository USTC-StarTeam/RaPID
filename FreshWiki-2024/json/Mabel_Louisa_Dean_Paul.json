  "summary": "Mabel Louisa Dean Paul (1872\u20131919) was a high-profile English socialite and novelist, and one of the most glamorous British women of the Edwardian era, who was the subject of widespread public and media interest. Over an extended period she also had an extraordinary ability for getting enmeshed in Society lawsuits.\nShe was divorced by her first husband, Colonel Thomas James Atherton (1856\u20131920), following an adulterous scandal involving one senior British royal, resulting in the eventual naming and shaming of Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster (1879\u20131953).",
