  "summary": "Luigi Nicholas Mangione (  loo-EE-jee MAN-jee-OH-nee; born May 6, 1998) is an American man who was identified as the suspect in the killing of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, which occurred in December 2024. \nAmidst a nationwide manhunt, Mangione was arrested and arraigned in Altoona, Pennsylvania, five days after the shooting. After waiving extradition in Pennsylvania, he appeared in a federal court in New York City. Mangione was arraigned in the New York Supreme Court and pleaded not guilty to his state charges. Mangione has been indicted on eleven state charges and faces four federal charges. These include first-degree murder, murder in furtherance of terrorism, criminal possession of a weapon, and stalking. The federal murder by firearm charge makes him eligible for the death penalty, although federal prosecutors have yet to indicate if they will pursue it.\nSince his arrest, Mangione has received support online, with some celebrating him as a folk hero. Opinion polls found that a majority of American adult respondents held a negative view toward Mangione, with younger and left-leaning respondents more likely to support him. The support Mangione has generated has been connected to negative views of the health insurance industry and harmful claim denial practices. The case has spurred growing calls for health insurance reform.",
