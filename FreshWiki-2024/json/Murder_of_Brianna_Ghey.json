  "summary": "On 11 February 2023, Brianna Ghey ( JY), a 16-year-old British transgender girl, was murdered in a premeditated attack by Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe. After being lured into Culcheth Linear Park by Jenkinson, Ghey was fatally stabbed.\nJenkinson and Ratcliffe, both aged 15 at the time, were arrested the next day and eventually charged and convicted of murder. They were convicted on 20 December 2023 at Manchester Crown Court and were both sentenced on 2 February 2024 to life imprisonment, with a minimum of 22 years for Jenkinson and 20 years for Ratcliffe before being eligible for parole. The court decided the offence was primarily motivated by sadistic tendencies and that hate against transgender people was a secondary motivation of Ratcliffe. The murder involved a significant degree of brutality and planning.",
