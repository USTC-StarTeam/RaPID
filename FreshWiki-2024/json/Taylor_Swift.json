  "summary": "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of widespread media coverage, with a vast fanbase known as Swifties.\nSwift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\" and \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nShifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and explored indie folk styles in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore. She experimented with subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024), and began re-recording her Big Machine albums as Taylor's Version due to an ownership dispute with the label. Through the 2020s, she garnered the US number one songs \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"All Too Well\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"Cruel Summer\", \"Is It Over Now?\", and \"Fortnight\". She has undertaken six concert tours, including the Eras Tour (2023\u20132024), the highest-grossing tour of all time. Her films include Miss Americana (2020), All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and The Eras Tour (2023)\u2014the highest-grossing concert film.\nSwift is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with a record seven albums that moved one million copies first-week. She is the highest-grossing touring artist, the first billionaire from music primarily, and the world's richest female musician. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard and Forbes, as well as the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Amongst her accolades are 14 Grammy Awards (including a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, and a record four IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards. Swift is the most-awarded artist of the American Music Awards (40), the Billboard Music Awards (49), and the MTV Video Music Awards (30). She is an advocate of artists' rights and women's empowerment.",
