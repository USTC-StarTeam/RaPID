  "summary": "Wonka is a 2023 musical fantasy film co-produced by Village Roadshow Pictures, The Roald Dahl Story Company, Heyday Films, and Domain Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It was directed by Paul King, who co-wrote the screenplay with Simon Farnaby. The film stars Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the title character and features Calah Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas, Mathew Baynton, Sally Hawkins, Rowan Atkinson, Jim Carter, Olivia Colman, and Hugh Grant. The film involves Willy Wonka, a central character in the 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl, and is a prequel to the first film based on said book, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, that depicts Willy Wonka's early days as a chocolatier.\nDevelopment began when Warner Bros. Pictures reacquired the film rights to the character in October 2016 and announced that the film would be an origin story. The film tells an original story and was developed by King to exist as a \"companion piece\" to the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory by reprising some of the music, thematic elements, and the visual design of the Oompa Loompas. In May 2021, Chalamet was confirmed to portray Wonka, and the supporting cast was announced in September of that year. Filming began in the United Kingdom in September, at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in Watford, as well as Oxford, Lyme Regis, Bath, St Albans, and at the Rivoli Ballroom in Crofton Park, London. The film's original songs were written by Neil Hannon and its original score was composed by Joby Talbot.\nWonka premiered in London at the Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre on November 28, 2023 and was released in the United Kingdom on December 8th, and in the United States on December 15th. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Chalamet's performance, the music, and the visuals, and was a box-office success, grossing over $634 million worldwide against a $125 million budget to become the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2023. It received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film and Chalamet was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy. A sequel is in development.",
