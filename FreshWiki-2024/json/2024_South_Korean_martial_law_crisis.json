  "summary": "On 3 December 2024, at 22:27 Korea Standard Time (KST), Yoon Suk Yeol, the president of South Korea, declared martial law  during a televised address. In his declaration, Yoon accused the Democratic Party (DPK), which has a majority in the National Assembly, of conducting \"anti-state activities\" and collaborating with \"North Korean communists\" to destroy the country, thereby creating a \"legislative dictatorship\". The order prohibited political activities, including gatherings of the National Assembly and local legislatures, and suspended the free press. Separately, Yoon reportedly ordered the arrest of various political opponents, including the leaders of the DPK and his own People Power Party. This event was widely characterized by Korean politicians and news organizations, both international and domestic, as an attempted self-coup.\nThe declaration was opposed by both parties and resulted in protests. At 01:02 on 4 December, 190 legislators who had arrived at the National Assembly Proceeding Hall unanimously passed a motion to lift martial law, despite attempts by the Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command to prevent the vote. At 04:30, Yoon and his cabinet lifted martial law and soon disbanded the Martial Law Command.\nThe opposition subsequently began impeachment proceedings against Yoon and said it would continue to do so if he did not resign. Uproar over the declaration has led to the resignation of several officials in Yoon's administration, including Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, and investigations into Yoon, other officials of his administration, and military officers for their role in the implementation of the decree.\nOn 7 December, Yoon issued an apology for declaring martial law and said that he would not do it again. On 12 December, he stated that he would \"fight to the end\" and that the martial law declaration was an \"act of governance\" to protect against anti-state forces. It is more widely believed the declaration was motivated by political issues with the DPK-controlled Assembly over repeated impeachment attempts against officials, opposition to his budget, and various scandals involving him and his wife Kim Keon-hee.\nYoon was impeached on 14 December by the National Assembly and suspended from office pending a final ruling by the Constitutional Court on whether to confirm his removal from the presidency. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo briefly served as acting president until he was also impeached on 27 December, making Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok acting president.\nYoon was arrested on 15 January 2025, becoming the first sitting president to be arrested in South Korean history.",
