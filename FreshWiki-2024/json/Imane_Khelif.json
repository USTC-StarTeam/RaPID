  "summary": "Imane Khelif (Arabic: \u0625\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u064a\u0641, romanized: \u02be\u012am\u0101n Khal\u012bf, pronounced [\u0294i\u02d0\u02c8ma\u02d0n xa\u02c8li\u02d0f]; born 2 May 1999) is an Algerian professional boxer. She won the gold medal in the women's 66 kg (welterweight) boxing event at the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nFollowing Khelif's victory over Italy's Angela Carini during the 2024 Olympic Games, misinformation surfaced on social media about her gender and eligibility to compete. False claims that Khelif is male were fueled by Khelif's disqualification from the 2023 Women's World Boxing Championships, organised by the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) after she allegedly failed unspecified gender eligibility tests. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its Paris Boxing Unit stated Khelif was eligible to compete in the Olympics and criticized the IBA's previous disqualification as \"sudden and arbitrary\" and taken \"without any due process\". Khelif was born female, and no medical evidence that she has XY chromosomes or elevated levels of testosterone has been published.",
