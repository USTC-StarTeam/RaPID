  "summary": "There were many kingdoms and empires in all regions of the continent of Africa throughout history. A kingdom is a state with a king or queen as its head. An empire is a political unit made up of several territories, military outposts, and peoples, \"usually created by conquest, and divided between a dominant centre and subordinate peripheries\".\nIn Africa states emerged in a process covering many generations and centuries. Most states were created through conquest or the borrowing and assimilation of ideas and institutions, while some developed through internal, largely isolated development. Economic development \"gave rise to a perceived need for centralized institutions and \u2018territorial\u2019 leadership that transcended older bonds of kinship and community\". The politicoreligious struggle between the people and the king sometimes saw the people victorious and the establishment of sacred kings with little political power (termed adverse sacralisation), contrasted with divine kings equated to gods. Kings and queens used both 'instrumental power', the employment of direct influence to achieve a desired outcome, and 'creative power', the use of ritual and mythology.:\u200a21\u201323\u200a  \nDespite this, popular understanding often claims that the continent lacked large states or meaningful complex political organisation. Whether rooted in ignorance, Eurocentrism, or racism, famous historians such as Hugh Trevor-Roper have argued that African history is not characterised by state formation or hierarchical structures. In fact, the nature of political organisation varied greatly across the continent, from the expansive West Sudanic empires, to the sacral Congolese empires akin to confederations or commonwealths, and the immensely hierarchical kingdoms of the Great Lakes.   \nThe vast majority of states included in this list existed prior to the Scramble for Africa (c. 1880\u20131914) when, driven by the Second Industrial Revolution, European powers rapidly colonised Africa. While most states were conquered and dissolved, some kings and elites negotiated the terms of colonial rule,:\u200a15\u200a and traditional power structures were incorporated into the colonial regimes as a form of indirect rule.\nIn the mid-late 20th century decolonisation saw Africans inherit the former colonies, and many traditional kingdoms still exist today as non\u2013sovereign monarchies. The roles, powers, and influence of non\u2013sovereign monarchs throughout Africa vary greatly depending on the state. In some states, such as Angola, the local monarch may play an integral role in the local governing council of a region. On the flipside their powers may be curtailed, as happened in 2022 with Wadai in Chad, or their positions abolished, as happened in Tanzania in 1962, and in 1966 in Uganda with Buganda, which was later restored in 1993. In this list they are labelled (NSM).\nThere are only three current sovereign monarchies in Africa; two of which (Lesotho and Morocco) are constitutional monarchies where the rulers are bound by laws and customs in the exercise of their powers, while one (Eswatini) is an absolute monarchy where the monarch rules without bounds.:\u200a15\u200a Sovereign monarchies are labelled (SM).\nThere have been a number of autocratic presidents in Africa who have been characterised as \"disguised monarchs\" due to the absence of term limits, as well as those who have invoked hereditary succession in order to preserve their regimes, such as the Bongos of Gabon, Gnassingb\u00e9s of Togo, or Aptidon\u2013Guelleh of Djibouti, attracting the terms monarchical republic and presidential monarchism. These have been tentatively included, and are labelled (MR).",
