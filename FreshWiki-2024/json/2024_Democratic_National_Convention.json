  "summary": "The 2024 Democratic National Convention was a presidential nominating convention in which delegates of the United States Democratic Party \nvoted on their party platform and ceremonially reported their vote to nominate Vice President Kamala Harris for president and her chosen running mate Governor Tim Walz for vice president in the 2024 presidential election. It was held from August 19 to 22, 2024, at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois. Delegates virtually nominated Harris and Walz the first week of August. Harris is the first Black woman and first Indian woman to be the presidential nominee of a major political party in the United States, and the first Democratic presidential nominee from the Western United States.\nEarlier, on March 12, incumbent President Joe Biden became the presumptive nominee, running against several candidates, which included an incumbent Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives during the primaries. Other than Biden, the only presidential candidates who were awarded pledged delegates to the 2024 Democratic National Convention based on the results of the primaries were U.S. Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota and businessman Jason Palmer.Conflicts with ballot deadlines led the Democratic National Committee to vote on June 20 to allow an early online nomination vote. Following his June 27 debate performance and decision on July 21 to withdraw his candidacy, Biden endorsed Harris. And though Biden had endorsed Harris as the new candidate at the top of the ticket, there was no obligation for the delegates to follow suit. With the other most viable presidential prospects endorsing Harris, she secured the non-binding support of enough convention delegates to make her the new presumptive nominee the next day, and Harris was the only candidate with enough delegate support to be on the ballot for the virtual roll call. The atypical circumstances were described by The New York Times as starting a campaign \"unlike any in modern times\". Throughout the fourth and final night, Beyonc\u00e9 and others were heavily rumored to make an unannounced appearance, leading to rampant speculation on social media that ultimately failed to materialize. Some delegates after the convention said that they tested positive for COVID-19 due to so many people being at the convention.\nHarris and Walz would go on to lose the 2024 election to the Republican Party ticket of former president Donald Trump and Ohio Senator JD Vance.",
