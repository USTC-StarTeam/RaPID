  "summary": "Mean Girls is a 2024 American teen musical comedy film directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. from a screenplay written by Tina Fey. It is based on the stage musical of the same name, which in turn was inspired by the 2004 film of the same name, both also written by Fey, and based on the 2002 book Queen Bees and Wannabes by Rosalind Wiseman. It stars Angourie Rice, Rene\u00e9 Rapp, Auli\u02bbi Cravalho, and Christopher Briney. Fey and Tim Meadows reprise their roles from the original film.\nParamount Pictures announced the film's development in January 2020, with Fey returning to write the screenplay and serve as a producer alongside Lorne Michaels, who produced the 2004 film. Composer Jeff Richmond and lyricist Nell Benjamin returned to rework their songs from the stage musical, while Richmond also composed the film's score. Casting began in December 2022. Principal photography took place in New Jersey between March and April 2023. Originally set for release on the streaming service Paramount+, Paramount Pictures opted to release the film theatrically after positive test screenings.\nMean Girls premiered at the AMC Lincoln Square in New York City on January 8, 2024, and was released in the United States by Paramount Pictures on January 12. The film grossed over $104 million worldwide on a $36 million budget and received mixed reviews.",
