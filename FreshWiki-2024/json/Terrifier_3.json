  "summary": "Terrifier 3 is a 2024 American Christmas slasher film co-produced, written, edited, and directed by Damien Leone. It is the sequel to Terrifier 2 (2022) and the third installment in the Terrifier film series.  The film stars David Howard Thornton, Lauren LaVera, Elliott Fullam, and Samantha Scaffidi. On the days leading up to Christmas, Sienna Shaw attempts to rebuild her life, while pursued by Art the Clown alongside his new accomplice, a possessed Victoria Heyes.\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of Terrifier 2, Leone began writing for the third film with plans for an overarching narrative. Leone wanted to feature Victoria more prominently, as he regretted leaving the character underdeveloped in the first film. Principal photography began in February 2024 on a $2 million budget, and wrapped that April.\nTerrifier 3 premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 19, 2024, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 11, by Cineverse and Iconic Events Releasing. It received positive reviews and became a box office success, grossing $89.8 million on a $2 million budget which is the highest-grossing unrated film, Cineverse's highest-grossing film, Leone's highest-grossing film of his career, and the highest-grossing film of the franchise.",
