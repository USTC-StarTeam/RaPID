  "summary": "Presidential elections were held in Venezuela on 28 July 2024 to choose a president for a six-year term beginning on 10 January 2025. The election was contentious, with international monitors calling it neither free nor fair, citing the incumbent Maduro administration having controlled most institutions and repressed the political opposition before, during, and after the election.  Widely viewed as having won the election, former diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez fled to asylum in Spain amid repression of dissent and a national and international political crisis that resulted when Venezuelan electoral authorities announced\u2014without presenting any evidence\u2014that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had won.\nMaduro ran for a third consecutive term, while Gonz\u00e1lez represented the Unitary Platform (Spanish: Plataforma Unitaria Democr\u00e1tica; PUD), the main opposition political alliance. In June 2023, the Venezuelan government had barred leading candidate Mar\u00eda Corina Machado from participating. This move was regarded by the opposition as a violation of political human rights and was condemned by international bodies such as the Organization of American States (OAS), the European Union, and Human Rights Watch, as well as numerous countries.\nAcademics, news outlets and the opposition provided strong evidence showing that Gonz\u00e1lez won the election by a wide margin with the opposition releasing copies of official tally sheets collected by poll watchers from a majority of polling centers showing a landslide victory for Gonz\u00e1lez. The government-controlled National Electoral Council (CNE) announced falsified results claiming a narrow Maduro victory on 29 July; vote tallies were not provided. The Carter Center was unable to verify the CNE's results, asserting the election failed to meet international democratic election standards.  The CNE's results were rejected by the OAS, and the United Nations declared that there was \"no precedent in contemporary democratic elections\" for announcing a winner without providing tabulated results. Analyses by media sources found the CNE results statistically improbable and lacking in credibility. Parallel vote tabulation confirmed the win by Gonz\u00e1lez. Political scientist Steven Levitsky called the official results \"one of the most egregious electoral frauds in modern Latin American history\".\nProtests occurred across the country and internationally, as the Maduro administration initiated Operation Tun Tun, a crackdown on dissent. Some world leaders rejected the CNE's claimed results and recognized Gonz\u00e1lez as the election winner, while some other countries, including Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and Cuba recognized Maduro as the winner.  Maduro did not cede power, and instead asked the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ), composed of justices loyal to Maduro, to audit and approve the results.  On 22 August, as anticipated, the TSJ described the CNE's statement of Maduro winning the election as \"validated\". The supreme court ruling was rejected by the United States, the European Union and ten Latin American countries. An arrest warrant was issued on 2 September for Gonz\u00e1lez for the alleged crimes of \"usurpation of functions, falsification of public documents, instigation to disobey the law, conspiracy and association\", according to Reuters. After seeking asylum in the Spanish Embassy in Caracas, Gonz\u00e1lez left for Spain on 7 September. Maduro was sworn in for a third term on 10 January 2025.",
