  "summary": "On March 26, 2024, at 1:28 a.m. EDT (05:28 UTC), the main spans and the three nearest northeast approach spans of the Francis Scott Key Bridge across the Patapsco River in the Baltimore metropolitan area of Maryland, United States, collapsed after the container ship Dali struck one of its piers. Six members of a maintenance crew working on the roadway were killed, while two more were rescued from the river.\nThe collapse blocked most shipping to and from the Port of Baltimore for 11 weeks. Maryland Governor Wes Moore called the event a \"global crisis\" that had affected more than 8,000 jobs. The economic impact of the closure of the waterway has been estimated at $15 million per day.\nMaryland officials have said they plan to replace the bridge by fall 2028 at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.",
