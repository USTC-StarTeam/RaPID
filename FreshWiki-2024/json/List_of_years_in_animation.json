  "summary": "== 1850s ==\n1854 \u2013 In London, the Welsh photographer John Dillwyn Llewelyn exhibited several early instantaneous photographs of the seaside. In 1855, he demonstrated these photographs at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. His works were well-received by critics, with detailed analysis of how well the waves were pictured. Llewelyn probably was an early adopter of the use of an automatic shutter, though the start date for this practice is uncertain.\n1855 \u2013 In 1855, the Austrian-German physiologist Johann Nepomuk Czermak published an article about his Stereophoroskop and other experiments aimed at stereoscopic moving images. He mentioned a method of sticking needles in a stroboscopic disc so that it looked like one needle was being pushed in and out of the cardboard when animated. He realized that this method provided basically endless possibilities to make different 3D animations. He then introduced two methods to animate stereoscopic pairs of images, one was basically a stereo viewer using two stroboscopic discs and the other was more or less similar to the later zoetrope. Czermak explained how suitable stereoscopic photographs could be made by recording a series of models, for instance to animate a growing pyramid.\n1856 \u2013 Publication of Majama\u2019 al-Bahrayn (1856) by al-Yaziji. It is a modern example of the maqama genre of picaresque short stories. The illustrations of the genre tend to share formal qualities with the art of shadow play. Shadow plays are considered a precursor to silhouette animation.\n1857 \u2013 In 1857, the earliest known illustration of a vertical biunial magic lantern, probably provided by E.G. Wood, appeared in the Horne & Thornthwaite catalogue. Biunial lanterns, with two projecting optical sets in one apparatus, were produced to more easily project dissolving views.\n1858 \u2013 In 1858, the physicist Joseph-Charles d'Almeida published descriptions of two methods that he had successfully developed to project stereoscopic images. The first was an anaglyph method with red and green glasses, the second used the stroboscopic principle to alternately present each picture to the corresponding eye in quick succession. D'Almeida had started work on combining this method with the principles of the phenakistiscope.\n1859 \u2013 On April 7, 1859, the Belgian civil engineer and inventor Henri D\u00e9sir\u00e9 du Mont filed a Belgian patent for nine different versions of his Omniscope, of which most would show stereoscopic animation from stroboscopic discs or from cylinders with pictures on the outside. One version was built inside a peep-box and had a lens focusing a light-beam to project the image on a frosted glass screen. Another design combined two zoetropes with Charles Wheatstone's reflecting stereoscope in between.",
