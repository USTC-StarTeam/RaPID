  "summary": "Yahya Ibrahim Hassan Sinwar (Arabic: \u064a\u062d\u064a\u0649 \u0625\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631, romanized: Ya\u1e25y\u00e1 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u1e24asan al-Sinw\u0101r; 29 October 1962 \u2013 16 October 2024) was a Palestinian militant and politician who served as chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau from August 2024, and as the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip from February 2017, until he was killed in a clash with the IDF in October 2024, succeeding Ismail Haniyeh in both roles.\nSinwar was born in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in Egyptian-occupied Gaza in 1962 to a family who had been expelled or fled from Majdal 'Asqalan during the 1948 Palestine War. He finished his studies at the Islamic University of Gaza, where he received a bachelor's degree in Arabic studies. In 1989, Sinwar was sentenced to four life sentences in Israel for orchestrating the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians he considered to be collaborators. He spent 22 years in prison until his release among 1,026 others in a 2011 prisoner exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. During his time in prison, Sinwar continued to coordinate the military activities of Hamas. Sinwar was one of the co-founders of the security apparatus of Hamas.\nIn 2017, Sinwar was elected as the leader of Hamas in Gaza and claimed to pursue \"peaceful, popular resistance\" the following year, supporting the 2018\u20132019 Gaza border protests, though he is also reported to have been dedicated to eradicating Israel and is said to have seen military confrontation as the only path to \"liberating Palestine\", saying that this would be achieved \"by force, not negotiations\". He also developed strong ties with Iran. Re-elected as Hamas leader in 2021, Sinwar survived an assassination attempt by Israel that same year. He is widely regarded as the mastermind behind the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel in 2023, which was followed by the Israel\u2013Hamas war that spilled over to other parts of the Middle East.\nHamas and the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades have been designated terrorist organisations by the United States, the European Union, and other countries and, in September 2015, Sinwar was specifically designated a terrorist by the United States government. In May 2024, Karim Khan, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, announced his intention to apply for an arrest warrant for Sinwar for war crimes and crimes against humanity, as part of the ICC investigation in Palestine. Sinwar was killed on 16 October 2024, during a firefight with the Israeli military.",
