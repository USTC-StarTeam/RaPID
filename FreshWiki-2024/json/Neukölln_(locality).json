  "summary": "Neuk\u00f6lln (German: [n\u0254\u028f\u02c8k\u0153ln] ; formerly Rixdorf), from 1899 to 1920 an independent city, is a large inner-city quarter of Berlin in the homonymous borough of Neuk\u00f6lln, and evolved around the historic village of Rixdorf. With 163,735 inhabitants (2024) the quarter has the second-largest population of Berlin after Prenzlauer Berg. Since the early 13th century, the local settlements, villages and cities down to the present day have always been a popular destination for colonists and immigrants. In modern times, it was originally shaped by the working class and gastarbeiters, but western immigration since the turn of the millennium has led to gentrification and a rejuvenation of the quarter's culture and night life.",
