  "summary": "B\u00f8rsen (Danish for \"the bourse\" or \"the stock exchange\"), is a 17th-century commodity bourse and later stock exchange in the centre of Copenhagen, Denmark. The historic building is situated next to Christiansborg Palace, the seat of the Danish Parliament, on the island of Slotsholmen.\nBuilt under the reign of Christian IV in 1619\u20131640, the building is considered a leading example of the Dutch Renaissance style in Denmark. It is a protected building for conservation purposes. A popular tourist attraction, B\u00f8rsen is most noted for its distinctive spire, shaped as the tails of four dragons twined together, reaching a height of 56 m (184 ft). On 16 April 2024, the building was severely damaged by a fire, which toppled the spire.",
