  "summary": "The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season was a very active and extremely destructive Atlantic hurricane season, producing 18 named storms, 11 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes; it was also the first since 2019 to feature multiple Category 5 hurricanes. Additionally, the season had the highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating since 2020, with a value of 161.6 units. The season officially began on June 1, and ended on November 30. These dates, adopted by convention, have historically described the period in each year when most subtropical or tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe first system, Tropical Storm Alberto, developed on June 19, making it the latest first named storm since 2014. Alberto made landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas the next day. Afterward, two storms formed in quick succession at the end of June, with the first, Hurricane Beryl, being a rare June major hurricane, the earliest Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record, and only the second recorded in July. Next came Tropical Storm Chris, which formed on the last day of June and quickly made landfall in Veracruz. Activity then quieted down across the basin for most of July after Beryl dissipated, with no new tropical cyclones forming due to the presence of the Saharan air layer (SAL) across much of the Atlantic. In early August, Hurricane Debby developed in the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall in Florida and South Carolina. Shortly thereafter came Hurricane Ernesto, which impacted the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda in mid-August. After an unusual lull in activity in late August and early September, Hurricane Francine formed in the Gulf, then made landfall in Louisiana.\nActivity dramatically increased in late September with several strong storms developing. Hurricane Helene developed over the western Caribbean before moving toward the Big Bend region of Florida and making landfall there on September 26 at Category 4 strength, causing catastrophic flooding and numerous fatalities over central Appalachia. Hurricane Kirk formed soon after and rapidly intensified into a Category 4 hurricane in the Eastern Atlantic before striking Europe as a post-tropical cyclone. October was also very active, with four named storms developing during the month, of which all but one were hurricanes. The strongest, Hurricane Milton, formed in the Gulf of Mexico and explosively intensified into the second Category 5 hurricane of the season; it was also the strongest tropical cyclone worldwide in 2024. Milton later made landfall near Siesta Key, Florida, on October 9, as a Category 3 hurricane. In mid-October, Tropical Storm Nadine and Hurricane Oscar formed in quick succession, with the former quickly making landfall in Belize while the latter rapidly intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, and achieved the smallest hurricane-force wind field on record in the Atlantic. It made landfall in Inagua and Cuba. In early November, Hurricane Rafael made landfall in western Cuba at Category 3 strength, and later attained sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h), tying 1985's Hurricane Kate as the strongest November hurricane on record in the Gulf of Mexico. In mid-November, the last system, Tropical Storm Sara, moved very slowly along the coast of Honduras, before making landfall in Belize, while producing widespread heavy rainfall resulting in severe flash flooding and mudslides across northern Central America.",
