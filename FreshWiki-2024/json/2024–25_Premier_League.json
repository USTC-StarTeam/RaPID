  "summary": "The 2024\u201325 Premier League is the 33rd season of the Premier League and the 126th season of top-flight English football overall. \nThe fixtures were released on 18 June 2024, consisting of 33 weekend rounds, four midweek rounds, and one Bank Holiday matchweek. The two-week winter break, in effect since the 2019\u201320 season, was scrapped starting this season in favour of a longer summer break for the players. Longer intervals between matches were added for the holiday period between Christmas and New Year's Day, with no matches held on Christmas Eve.\nThe summer transfer window opened on Friday 14 June 2024 and closed at 23:00 BST on Friday 30 August 2024. The winter window opened on Wednesday 1 January 2025 and will close at 23:00 GMT on Monday 3 February 2025.\nThis season is the first to use semi-automated offside technology, as Premier League clubs unanimously agreed to its introduction. The technology will be ready to be introduced after one of the autumn international breaks.\nManchester City entered the season as four-time defending champions, the first men's side to do so in the top flight of English football.",
