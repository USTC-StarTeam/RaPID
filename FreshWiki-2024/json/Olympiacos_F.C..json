  "summary": "Olympiacos F.C. (Greek: \u03a0\u0391\u0395 \u039f\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a3.\u03a6.\u03a0. [oli(m)bia\u02c8kos]), known simply as Olympiacos or Olympiacos Piraeus, is a Greek professional football club based in Piraeus. Part of the major multi-sport club Olympiacos CFP (Olympiak\u00f3s S\u00fdndesmos Fil\u00e1thlon Peirai\u00f3s, \"Olympic Association of Piraeus Sportsmen\"), their name was inspired from the ancient Olympic Games and along with the club's emblem, the laurel-crowned Olympic athlete, symbolize the Olympic ideals of ancient Greece. Their home ground is the Karaiskakis Stadium, a 33,334-capacity stadium in Piraeus.\nFounded on 10 March 1925, Olympiacos is the most successful club in Greek football history, having won 47 league titles, 28 Cups (18 doubles), four Super Cups, all records, and three international titles (the UEFA Europa Conference League in 2023\u201324, the UEFA Youth League in 2023-24, and the Balkans Cup in 1963). The club has 171 titles (79 national, 27 regional, 37 others, and three international), and as of 2018 was ninth in the world in total titles won by a football club. The club's dominating success is further evidenced in that all other Greek clubs have won a combined total of 41 league titles. while Olympiacos also holds the record for the most consecutive Greek League titles won, with seven in a row in two occasions (1997\u20132003 and 2011\u20132017), breaking their own previous record of six consecutive wins in the 1950s (1954\u20131959), when Olympiacos was unequivocally nicknamed Thrylos (Greek: \u0398\u03c1\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \"The Legend\"). Having won the 2014\u201315 League title, Olympiacos became the only football club in the world to have won five or more consecutive championships five times in their history. They are also the only Greek club to have won six consecutive national Cups (1957\u20131963) as well as six League titles undefeated (1937, 1938, 1948, 1951, 1954, 1955). Olympiacos are one of only three clubs to have never been relegated from the top flight of Greek football, and by winning the 2012\u201313 title, their 40th in total, they added a fourth star above their crest, each representing 10 league titles.\nInternationally, Olympiacos is the only Greek football club in history to win a major European trophy, winning the UEFA Europa Conference League, in 2023\u201324. With their 2024 triumph, they became the first club outside the biggest four European leagues (Premier League, Serie A, La Liga and Bundesliga) to win a UEFA competition since 2011, and they added a 5th star above their crest, representing their European victory. They are also the highest ranked Greek club in the UEFA rankings, occupying the 36th place in the ten-year ranking, and the 43rd in the five-year ranking as of 2024. They are one of the founding members of the European Club Association.\nOlympiacos is the most popular football club in Greece, and gathering strong support from Greek communities all over the world. With 83,000 registered members as of April 2006, the club was ninth in the 2006 list of football clubs with the most paying members in the world, which increased to 98,000 in 2014. Olympiacos share a longstanding rivalry with Panathinaikos, with whom they contest in the \"derby of the eternal enemies\", the most classic football derby in Greece and one of the best-known around the world.",
