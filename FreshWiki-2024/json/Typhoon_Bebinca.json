  "summary": "Typhoon Bebinca, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Ferdie, was a strong tropical cyclone that affected East China, Guam, Philippines and the Ryukyu Islands in early September 2024. Bebinca made landfall in Shanghai, China, becoming the strongest typhoon to hit the city since Typhoon Gloria in 1949. The thirteenth named storm and sixth typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Bebinca formed from atmospheric convection 385 km (239 mi) east-northeast of Kosrae, was upgraded to a tropical storm by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) on September 10, and was named Bebinca, before turning west-northwest due to interaction with an upper vortex; by September 13, as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration named it Ferdie, and it eventually moved across the Ryukyu Islands, where both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and the JMA upgraded it to a minimal typhoon. Inland, Bebinca quickly weakened to a severe tropical storm due to land interaction as it moved west-northwest under the steering influence of the subtropical high. The JMA tracked the system until it was last noted on September 18. \nAlthough Typhoon Bebinca did not make landfall in the Philippines, its associated trough and the southwest monsoon brought heavy rains to many regions, damaging or destroying nearly 97 homes and displacing over 36,626 people. The storm caused at least six fatalities, with two people missing and eleven injuries. In China, Bebinca caused two fatalities and one injury, but the country was soon impacted by Tropical Storm Pulasan just days later. Bebinca significantly affected Guam, leading to storm warnings being issued. In Japan, thousands of homes lost power in Amami, and high winds were recorded in Okinawa Prefecture. Overall, Bebinca caused an estimated US$2.49 billion in damage across the Philippines and China.",
