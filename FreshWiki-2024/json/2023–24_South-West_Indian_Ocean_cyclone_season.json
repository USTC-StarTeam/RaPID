  "summary": "The 2023\u201324 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was an above-average season, including ten named storms (including an unnamed tropical storm), six tropical cyclones and two intense tropical cyclones. Despite its moderate activity, it was the least deadly and destructive season in three years. It is the current event of the annual cycle of tropical and subtropical cyclogenesis. It began on 15 November 2023, and ended on 30 April 2024, with the exception for Mauritius and the Seychelles, where it ended on 15 May 2024. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical and subtropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of 90\u00b0E and south of the Equator. However, tropical cyclones can form year-round, and all tropical cyclones that formed between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024 would be part of the season. Tropical and subtropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in R\u00e9union and unofficially by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.",
