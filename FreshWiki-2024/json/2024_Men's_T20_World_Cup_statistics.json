  "summary": "The 2024 Men's T20 World Cup was the ninth edition of the Men's T20 World Cup, a biennial T20I tournament held between men's national cricket teams, organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States from 1 to 29 June 2024.\nThe tournament expanded to 20 teams from 16 teams in 2022. This was the first major ICC tournament to feature matches played in the United States with Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas and Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, New York hosting their first ever T20I matches, with the latter being subject to criticism due to the pitch quality. Canada, Uganda and the United States made their T20 World Cup debuts, with the US progressing to the Super 8 stage.\nFazalhaq Farooqi and Arshdeep Singh set a new record for most wickets at a single edition of the T20 World Cup. Pat Cummins took two consecutive hat-tricks becoming the only player to take more than one in the T20 World Cup. Shakib Al Hasan took 50 wickets in T20 World Cups, the first bowler to do so. Rohit Sharma became the highest run-scorer in T20Is, surpassing Babar Azam and Virat Kohli. Niko Davin was dismissed retired out, first such instance in a T20 World Cup match. Afghanistan played in the semi-finals of any major ICC Tournament for the first time while, South Africa played in their maiden T20 World Cup final. India won their second T20 World Cup title, equalling the West Indies and England in most tournaments won, while also becoming the first team in T20 World Cup history to win the title undefeated throughout the tournament.",
