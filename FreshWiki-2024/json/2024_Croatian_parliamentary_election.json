  "summary": "Parliamentary elections were held in Croatia on 17 April 2024 to elect the members of the 11th Sabor. Prior to the elections, the government consisted of a coalition of the Croatian Democratic Union and Independent Democratic Serb Party, with parliamentary support of five national minority MPs, two MPs from the Croatian Social Liberal Party and Croatian Demochristian Party, and one independent MP, Silvano Hrelja.\nThe ruling centre-right HDZ won the most seats for the fourth straight election, defeating the centre-left Rivers of Justice alliance. The right-wing populist Homeland Movement finished third, with the left-wing and green We can! in fourth place. The HDZ subsequently formed a right-wing coalition with the Homeland Movement and returned HDZ leader Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 as Prime Minister for a third term.",
