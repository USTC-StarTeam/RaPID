  "summary": "Yoon Suk Yeol (Korean: \uc724\uc11d\uc5f4; born 18 December 1960) is a South Korean politician and prosecutor who has been the 13th president of South Korea since 2022. Following his impeachment, his powers are currently suspended. Yoon was born in Seoul and earned two degrees from Seoul National University. In his capacity as chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office, he played a key role in convicting former presidents Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak of abuse of power. In 2019, then-president Moon Jae-in appointed Yoon as Prosecutor General of South Korea from 2019 to 2021. During Yoon's leadership, the Supreme Prosecutor's Office conducted embattled investigations into Cho Kuk, an influential figure in the Moon administration, that led to Cho's resignation as Minister of Justice. Yoon's clashes with the Moon administration prior to his resignation as prosecutor general in March 2021 led to his rise as a potential presidential candidate among conservative voters. \nIn June 2021, Yoon announced his candidacy in the 2022 South Korean presidential election. He joined the right-wing People Power Party (PPP) in July and won its nomination in November. Considered a conservative and economically liberal politician, Yoon ran on a platform promising economic deregulation and measures such as abolishing the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. He narrowly defeated Democratic Party nominee Lee Jae-myung by less than a percentage point on 9 March 2022 and assumed office as president on 10 May, becoming the first elected president to be born after the end to fighting in the Korean War. During his presidency, Yoon's foreign policy has been described as both more hawkish toward North Korea and friendlier to Japan compared to previous South Korean presidents. His handling of the Seoul Halloween crowd crush in 2022 and the ongoing medical crisis has attracted criticism. In the 2024 parliamentary midterm elections, Yoon's party suffered an electoral defeat, which weakened his political power.\nUnder Yoon's tenure, South Korea has undergone democratic backsliding and a shift towards authoritarianism. He has received mostly low approval ratings as president and has been described as a lame duck.\nOn 3 December 2024, Yoon declared martial law in South Korea, the first time it had been declared since the military dictatorship of Chun Doo-hwan in 1980. He justified the declaration by accusing members of the National Assembly of being pro-North Korea; however, Yoon lifted it after the National Assembly passed an emergency motion nullifying the declaration several hours after Yoon's speech. Amid widespread criticism over the declaration and the mass protests it spurred, an impeachment motion was introduced against Yoon on 4 December in the National Assembly, though it fell short of the 200 votes needed to pass.  He was successfully impeached and temporarily suspended from his presidential powers in a second vote on 14 December 2024, with 204 voting in favor, including 12 members of his own party. The Constitutional Court of Korea is in the process of determining whether he should be removed from office. On 31 December 2024, Yoon became the first President in South Korean history to face an arrest warrant, and on 15 January 2025 became the first sitting president to be arrested. He has been incarcerated since 15 January 2025 at Seoul Detention Center.",
