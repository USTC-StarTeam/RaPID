  "summary": "The solar storms of May 2024 (also known as 2024 Mother's Day solar storm or Gannon storm in memory of Jennifer Gannon, a space weather physicist) were a series of powerful solar storms with extreme solar flares and geomagnetic storm components that occurred from 10\u201313 May 2024 during solar cycle 25. The geomagnetic storm was the most powerful to affect Earth since March 1989, and produced aurorae at far more equatorial latitudes than usual in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.",
