  "summary": "An armed conflict between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups has been taking place in the Gaza Strip and Israel since 7 October 2023. It is the fifth war of the Gaza\u2013Israel conflict since 2008, and the most significant military engagement in the region since the Yom Kippur War in 1973. It commenced with the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, is the deadliest war for Palestinians in the history of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, and has sparked an ongoing Middle Eastern crisis.\nOn 7 October 2023, Hamas-led militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing 1,195 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 815 civilians, and taking 251 captive. After clearing militants from its territory, Israel launched a destructive bombing campaign and invaded Gaza on 27 October with the stated objectives of destroying Hamas and freeing hostages. Israeli forces launched numerous campaigns during the invasion, including the Rafah offensive from May 2024, three battles fought around Khan Yunis, and the Siege of North Gaza from October 2024. Flashpoints attracting global attention included the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital explosion, the Flour massacre, the Tel al-Sultan attack, and the killing of five-year-old Hind Rajab. A temporary ceasefire in November 2023 broke down, but both sides agreed to a new deal on 15 January 2025, which took effect four days later.\nSince the start of the Israeli offensive, over 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been reported killed, over half of them women and children. The Lancet has estimated more than 70,000 direct deaths due to traumatic injuries. More than 100,000 Palestinians have also been injured. Israel's tightened blockade cut off basic necessities, causing a severe hunger crisis with a high risk of famine persisting as of November 2024. By early 2025, Israel had caused unprecedented destruction in Gaza and made large parts of it uninhabitable, leveling entire cities and destroying the healthcare system, agricultural land, religious and cultural landmarks, educational facilities, and cemeteries. Nearly all of the strip's 2.3 million Palestinian population have been forcibly displaced. Over 100,000 Israelis were internally displaced as of February 2024. Throughout the war, Israel assassinated several Hamas leaders in and outside of Gaza. Torture and sexual violence were committed by Palestinian militant groups and Israeli forces.\nThe war continues to have significant regional and international repercussions. Large, primarily pro-Palestinian, protests have taken place across the world calling for a ceasefire. Various experts and human rights organizations have accused both Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes, with some characterizing the events in Gaza as genocide. A case accusing Israel of committing genocide is being reviewed by the International Court of Justice, while the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders. Israel received extensive military and diplomatic support from the United States, which has vetoed multiple UN Security Council ceasefire resolutions. The war has reverberated regionally, with Axis of Resistance groups across several Arab countries and Iran clashing with Israel and the United States. By late 2024, a year of strikes between Israel and Hezbollah led to a brief Israeli invasion of Lebanon, as well as the fall of the Assad regime in Syria and an ongoing Israeli invasion of Syria.",
