  "summary": "The 2024 Pacific typhoon season was the fifth-latest starting Pacific typhoon season on record. It was average in terms of activity, and ended a four year streak of below average seasons that started in 2020. It was also the deadliest season since 2013, and became the fourth-costliest Pacific typhoon season on record, mostly due to Typhoon Yagi. This season saw an unusually active November, with the month seeing four simultaneously active named storms. The season runs throughout 2024, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. The season's first named storm, Ewiniar, developed on May 25, and eventually intensified into the first typhoon of the season, while the last named storm, Pabuk, dissipated on December 26. This season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in the western Pacific Ocean.\nThe scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100\u00b0E and 180th meridian. Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) will name a tropical cyclone if it has 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), located between 135\u00b0E and 115\u00b0E and between 5\u00b0N\u201325\u00b0N, regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) are given a number with a \"W\" suffix; W meaning west, a reference to the western Pacific region.",
