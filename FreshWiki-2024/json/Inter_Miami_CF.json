  "summary": "Club Internacional de F\u00fatbol Miami (lit. Miami International Football Club), better known as Inter Miami CF or simply Inter Miami (Spanish: Inter de Miami), is an American professional soccer club based in the Miami metropolitan area. The club competes in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Eastern Conference. Inter Miami plays their home matches at Chase Stadium, with plans to move to Miami Freedom Park in 2026.\nOn January 29, 2018, MLS officially approved an  {[expansion team]] in Miami. The club garnered international attention prior to their founding because of co-owner Beckham, and again in 2023 with the signing of Lionel Messi on a free transfer. Since the team began playing in the 2020 season, the club has signed several other high-profile players such as Blaise Matuidi, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, and Luis Su\u00e1rez.\nFollowing Messi's debut, the club won their first major trophy, the expanded 2023 Leagues Cup, which also qualified the team to the 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup for the first time. In the 2024 season, Inter Miami secured their first Supporters' Shield. The team's estimated value according to Forbes is $1.03 billion as of 2024, ranking second in the league behind Los Angeles FC.",
