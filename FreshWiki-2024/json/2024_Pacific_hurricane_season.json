  "summary": "The 2024 Pacific hurricane season was a below average season that saw 15 tropical cyclones develop overall, of which all but 2 became named storms. Of the 13 named storms, 5 developed into hurricanes, of which 3 intensified into major hurricanes. The season officially began on May 15 in the eastern Pacific basin (east of 140\u00b0W) and on June 1 in the central Pacific (between 140\u00b0W and the International Date Line); both ended on November 30. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most subtropical or tropical cyclogenesis occurs in these regions of the Pacific Ocean. For the third consecutive year, there were no pre-season tropical cyclones in either basin, and the season got off to the slowest start of any Pacific hurricane season on record in the satellite era,  with the first eastern Pacific tropical storm, Aletta, not forming until July 4. The first, and only, central Pacific tropical storm, Hone, formed on August 22, becoming the first named storm to develop in the basin since 2019. The final system of the season, Tropical Depression Fourteen\u2011E, dissipated on November 7.\nSeveral storms impacted land this year. Hurricane Hone dropped very heavy rainfall over the Big Island of Hawaii after passing just offshore at Category 1 strength. The remnants of Hurricane Gilma impacted the islands several days later, though neither cyclone caused significant damage. Tropical Storm Ileana grazed the coast of northwestern Mexico, resulting in flooding. Hurricane John made landfall on southern Mexico twice after rapidly intensifying to a Category 3 hurricane, causing 29 deaths and an estimated $2.5 billion in damage. The strongest storm of the season was Hurricane Kristy, which became the first Category 5 Pacific hurricane in a non-El Ni\u00f1o year since Celia in 2010.",
