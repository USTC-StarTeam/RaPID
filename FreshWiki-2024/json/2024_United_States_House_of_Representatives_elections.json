  "summary": "The 2024 United States House of Representatives elections were held on November 5, 2024, to elect the 435 representatives of the United States House of Representatives, as well as 6 non-voting delegates from the District of Columbia and inhabited U.S. territories. The elections were held together with other federal, state, and local elections, including the U.S. presidential election and elections to the Senate, as part of the 2024 United States general election. The winners of this election will serve in the 119th United States Congress, with seats apportioned among states based on the 2020 United States census.\nThe House Republican Conference has been led by Mike Johnson since October 2023, following the removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House and the speaker election that Johnson won. He is the first congressman from Louisiana to be elected Speaker of the House.\nWith the election of Hakeem Jeffries as leader of the House Democratic Caucus, this was the first House election since 2002 in which the Democratic Party was not led by Nancy Pelosi. Jeffries is the first African American in the history of Congress to serve as leader of either party, and the first congressman from New York to do so since Bertrand Snell's retirement in 1938.\nThe election was expected to be highly competitive, with forecasts suggesting less than a five-seat difference between the two parties. Events that have occurred during the 118th Congress include the January 2023 speakership election, the 2023 debt-ceiling crisis, the removal of Kevin McCarthy from the speakership, the ensuing October 2023 speakership election, and the expulsion of George Santos. No party has lost House control after a single congressional term since 1954.\nThe Republicans, led by incumbent Speaker Mike Johnson, narrowly maintained control of the House with a small majority of 220 seats (the narrowest since 1930), despite winning the House popular vote by 4 million votes and a margin of 2.6%. Democrats made a net gain of 1 seat from the Republicans, which represents the smallest net change in US history in the House of Representatives. The majority was decided by just over 7,000 votes across three congressional districts (Iowa's 1st, Colorado's 8th, and Pennsylvania's 7th); this was a roughly 2-point bias in favor of Democrats, resulting from Democratic outperformance in swing districts. Despite the Democratic overperformance, the results gave Republicans a government trifecta for the first time since the 2018 midterms.\nThis election marked the first time since 2016 where Republicans won a majority of the congressional delegation in Pennsylvania and Michigan. This election also marked the first time since 2008 in which Democrats won more than one seat in Alabama, and the first time since 2006 when Democrats won more than one seat in Louisiana. This election saw Republicans win the majority of congressional districts in 30 states while the Democrats won a majority in 18 states. Two states (Colorado and Minnesota) elected a split house delegation. Sarah McBride of Delaware became the first openly transgender member elected to the United States Congress.\nThis was the third presidential election cycle in a row in which the victorious presidential party lost seats in the House while holding its majority.",
