  "summary": "Hurricane Francine was a moderately strong tropical cyclone that brought extensive flooding to parts of the Gulf Coast of the United States, especially Louisiana in September 2024. The sixth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, its formation brought the end to a significant quiet period in tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic. Originating from a tropical wave that was initially spotted in the central Atlantic by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in late August, the disturbance that eventually became Francine began gradually organizing on September 7 as it exited the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula into the Bay of Campeche. The disturbance consolidated further and was designated by the NHC as Potential Tropical Cyclone Six on September 8. The next day, it was upgraded to tropical storm status and was named Francine by the NHC. It made landfall in Louisiana on September 11, 2024 as a Category 2 hurricane with wind speeds of 100 mph (161 km/h), which left moderate damage in Louisiana and Mississippi. Afterward, it quickly weakened into a tropical storm on September 12, then a tropical depression the following day. Francine dissipated on September 14.",
