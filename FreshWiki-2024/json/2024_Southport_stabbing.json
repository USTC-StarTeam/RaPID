  "summary": "On 29 July 2024, a mass stabbing targeting children occurred at a dance studio in Southport, Merseyside, United Kingdom. Seventeen-year-old Axel Rudakubana killed three children and injured ten others \u2013 eight of whom were children. The attack took place at a Taylor Swift\u2013themed yoga and dance workshop attended by 25 children at the Hart Space, a community studio in the Meols Cop area of Southport. Two girls died at the scene, six injured children and two adults were taken to hospital in a critical condition, and a third girl died the following day. \nThe day after the attack, far-right protesters clashed with police in Southport and damaged a mosque after misinformation about the attacker's identity \u2013 which had not yet been publicly released \u2013 was spread online. Over the next few days, protests and riots spread nationwide.\nRudakubana was arrested at the scene and charged with three counts of murder, ten counts of attempted murder, and possession of a bladed article. He was later separately charged under the Biological Weapons Act 1974 and Terrorism Act 2000 in relation to the possession of ricin and a military study of an Al-Qaeda training manual. He pleaded guilty to all 16 charges on 20 January 2025, when his trial was due to begin, having initially entered a not-guilty plea. No motive for the stabbings was discovered.\nAfter Rudakubana's guilty pleas, it emerged that he had a history of violent and concerning behaviour and had been referred to the anti-extremism programme Prevent three times between 2019 and 2021, but was not accepted into the scheme as no terrorist ideology was identified. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced an overhaul to terrorism laws to include non-ideological acts of violence, and appointed Sir David Anderson KC to lead a review of the Prevent programme.",
