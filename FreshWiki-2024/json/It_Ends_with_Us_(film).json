  "summary": "It Ends with Us is a 2024 American romantic drama film directed by Justin Baldoni from a screenplay by Christy Hall, based on the 2016 novel by Colleen Hoover. The film stars Blake Lively alongside Baldoni, Brandon Sklenar, Jenny Slate, and Hasan Minhaj. The story follows florist Lily Bloom (Lively), whose troubled relationship with neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (Baldoni) is compounded when her ex-boyfriend Atlas Corrigan (Sklenar) re-enters her life.\nPrincipal photography on It Ends with Us took place from mid 2023 to early 2024, with pauses due to the 2023 WGA strike and the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. It Ends with Us had its premiere at the AMC Lincoln Square in New York City on August 6, 2024, and was released by Sony Pictures Releasing in the United States on August 9. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but was a box-office success, grossing $351 million worldwide against a $25 million budget.\nThe production became mired in controversy due to disputes between Lively and Baldoni, with the former drawing criticism for not addressing the film's themes of domestic violence and emotional abuse during its promotional tour. In December 2024, Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni and his production company Wayfarer Studios, accusing them of sexual harassment and intimidation. Denying the allegations, Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel over their siding with Lively's account of events, and later sued Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicist Leslie Sloan for civil extortion, defamation, and invasion of privacy.",
