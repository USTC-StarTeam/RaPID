  "summary": "Paul Martin (June 6, 1883 \u2013 March 19, 1932) was an American commercial artist and illustrator. He designed the world's largest sign in 1917. It towered over Times Square until 1924. He drew a poster supporting the ongoing war effort in 1918. His artwork appeared on twenty covers of Collier's between 1923 and 1927. He won Parents' Magazine's \"Cover of the Year\" award for three straight years from 1928 to 1930. He reshaped the then-famous mascot of Fisk Tires in 1930. This new character appeared in thirteen issues of The Saturday Evening Post, 1930. Martin created the official poster for the Girl Scouts in 1931. It was displayed at their troop meetings from 1931 to 1937.\nHe played in sanctioned tennis tournaments around the New York metropolitan area from 1909 to 1931. This included the U.S. National Championships (now US Open) of 1920, 1921, and 1924. The Paul Martin singles tournament was held for eighty-four years, between 1932 and 2019. He played doubles with Franklin P. Adams, teamed with Vincent Richards, and collaborated on a book with Howard R. Garis. His WWI poster has been displayed at the International Tennis Hall of Fame since 1965.",
