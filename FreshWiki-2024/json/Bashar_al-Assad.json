  "summary": "Bashar al-Assad (born 11 September 1965) is a Syrian politician, military officer, and former dictator who served as the 19th president of Syria from 2000 until his government was overthrown by Syrian rebels in December 2024. As president, Assad was commander-in-chief of the Syrian Arab Armed Forces and secretary-general of the Central Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party. He is the son of Hafez al-Assad, who ruled Syria from 1971 until his death in 2000. \nIn the 1980s, Assad became a doctor, and in the early 1990s he was training in London as an ophthalmologist. In 1994, after his elder brother Bassel al-Assad died in a car crash, Assad was recalled to Syria to take over Bassel's role as heir apparent. Assad entered the military academy and took charge of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon in 1998. On 17 July 2000, Assad became president, succeeding his father, who had died on 10 June 2000. A series of crackdowns in 2001\u201302 ended the Damascus Spring, a period marked by calls for transparency and democracy.\nAssad's regime was a highly personalist dictatorship, which governed Syria as a totalitarian police state, and was marked by numerous human rights violations, war crimes, and severe repression. While the Assad government described itself as secular, various political scientists and observers noted that his regime exploited sectarian tensions in the country. Although Assad inherited the power structures and personality cult nurtured by his father, he lacked the loyalty received by his father and faced rising discontent against his rule. As a result, many people from his father's regime resigned or were purged, and the political inner-circle was replaced by staunch loyalists from Alawite clans. Assad's early economic liberalization programs worsened inequalities and centralised the socio-political power of the loyalist Damascene elite of the Assad family, alienating the Syrian rural population, urban working classes, businessmen, industrialists and people from once-traditional Ba'ath strongholds. The Cedar Revolution in Lebanon in February 2005, triggered by the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, forced Assad to end the Syrian occupation of Lebanon.\nAssad was responsible for one of the most repressive regimes in modern times. Assad's first decade in power was marked by extensive censorship, summary executions, forced disappearances, discrimination of ethnic minorities and extensive surveillance by the Ba'athist secret police. His deadly crackdown on Arab Spring protesters during the events of the Syrian revolution led to outbreak of the Syrian civil war. Between 2011 and 2024, over 600,000 people were killed in the civil war, with pro-Assad forces causing more than 90% of the total civilian deaths. The United States, European Union, and the majority of the Arab League called for Assad to resign in 2011, but he refused and the war continued. In 2013, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that findings from a UN inquiry directly implicated Assad directly in heinous atrocities and \"crimes against humanity\". Assad's perpetration of numerous war crimes led to international condemnation and isolation against his regime. Throughout the civil war, the Ba'athist Syrian armed forces also carried out several chemical attacks. \nIn November 2024, a coalition of Syrian rebels mounted several offensives with the intention of ousting Assad. On the morning of 8 December, as rebel troops first entered Damascus, Assad fled to Moscow and was granted political asylum by the Russian government. Later that day, Damascus fell to rebel forces, and Assad's regime collapsed.",
