  "summary": "The UEFA Euro 2024 final was a football match that determined the winners of UEFA Euro 2024. The match was the seventeenth final of the European Championship, a quadrennial tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of UEFA to decide the champions of Europe. The match was held at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany, on 14 July 2024, and was contested by Spain, in their fifth final, and England, in their second final, but their first appearance in a major men's tournament final held outside their home country. Following their defeat in the previous final, England also became the fourth different side to appear in two consecutive Euro finals, after the Soviet Union (1960 and 1964), West Germany (1972, 1976 and 1980), unified Germany (1992 and 1996), and Spain (2008 and 2012).\nIn front of a crowd of 65,600, Spain won the match 2\u20131 for their record-breaking fourth UEFA European Championship title (after 1964, 2008 and 2012), surpassing Germany as the sole record-winners of the competition. It was also their third title in the last five editions of the tournament.\nSpain won all seven matches they played in the competition, the first side to accomplish this since France won five out of five in 1984, and set a new record for most goals scored in a single European Championship, with fifteen. England, meanwhile, became the first side to lose consecutive finals. This was also the first time both finalists conceded in every knockout game contested since the tournament's expansion in 1980.",
