  "summary": "The 2024 Championship League Invitational (officially the 2024 BetVictor Championship League Invitational for sponsorship reasons) was a professional non\u2011ranking snooker tournament, which took place from 2 January 2024 to 13 March 2024 at the Leicester Arena in Leicester, England.\nJohn Higgins was the defending champion, having won the tournament for the fourth time after beating Judd Trump 3\u200d\u2013\u200d1 in the final of the 2023 event. He was defeated 3\u200d\u2013\u200d0 by Joe O'Connor in the Winners' Group semi\u2011finals.\nThere were three maximum breaks achieved during the tournament, by Kyren Wilson in Group 3, by John Higgins in Group 5, and by Joe O'Connor in Group 7. This is only the third time that three maximums have been made in an event, the first being at the 2012 UK Championship, and the second at the 2017 German Masters.\nMark Selby won the tournament, beating Joe O'Connor 3\u200d\u2013\u200d1 in the final.",
