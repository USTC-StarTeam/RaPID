  "summary": "The 2025 PDC World Darts Championship (known for sponsorship reasons as the 2024/25 Paddy Power World Darts Championship) was a professional darts tournament that was held from 15 December 2024 to 3 January 2025 at Alexandra Palace in London, England. It was the 32nd World Darts Championship to be organised by the Professional Darts Corporation and the 18th to be held at Alexandra Palace. The winner received \u00a3500,000 from a total prize fund of \u00a32,500,000.\nThe tournament featured 96 players, with the top 32 highest ranked players on the PDC Order of Merit being seeded through to the second round. Luke Humphries was the defending champion, having defeated Luke Littler 7\u20134 in the 2024 final. However, Humphries lost 4\u20131 to Peter Wright in the fourth round.\nIn his 3\u20131 second-round victory over Ryan Meikle, Littler set a new record for the highest three-dart set average in a World Championship match, with 140.91 in the final set. Littler went on to beat Nathan Aspinall 5\u20132 in the quarter-finals and Stephen Bunting 6\u20131 in the semi-finals to reach a second consecutive final, where he defeated Michael van Gerwen 7\u20133 to win his first world title. Aged 17 years and 347 days, Littler became the youngest world champion in darts history. He also won the Ballon d'Art trophy for scoring the most 180s in the tournament, with 76.\nChristian Kist and Damon Heta both hit nine-dart finishes at the tournament, with both players earning a \u00a360,000 bonus.",
