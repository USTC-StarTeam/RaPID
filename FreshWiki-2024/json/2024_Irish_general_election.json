  "summary": "The 2024 Irish general election to elect the 34th D\u00e1il took place on Friday, 29 November 2024, following the dissolution of the 33rd D\u00e1il on 8 November by President Michael D. Higgins at the request of Taoiseach Simon Harris. Polls were open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m UTC. It elected 174 Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la (TDs) across 43 constituencies of between 3 and 5 seats to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas, Ireland's legislature. Under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2023, the number of TDs was increased from 160 to 174, making it the largest D\u00e1il in the history of the state, with an increase in the number of constituencies from 39 to 43. The main issues in the campaign were the cost of living, housing affordability and availability, immigration and asylum management, and economic stability amid external trade uncertainties, reflecting voter concerns despite the country's strong overall financial health.\nThe election resulted in Fianna F\u00e1il remaining as the largest party, increasing its number of seats to 48. Its governing partner Fine Gael won 38 seats, with the two parties combined winning 86 seats, two shy of a majority. The Green Party, the third party of government, lost all but one of its seats, with only leader Roderic O'Gorman returning to the D\u00e1il. Sinn F\u00e9in remained as the second largest party, winning 39 seats, while the Social Democrats and Labour each won 11 seats, an increase of five each.\nOn 15 January 2025, the formation of a coalition government was agreed between Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael, and nine independents.",
