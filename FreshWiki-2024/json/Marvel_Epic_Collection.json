  "summary": "The Epic Collection is an ongoing line of color trade paperbacks that republish Marvel comics in a uniform trade dress. Announced in April 2013, their stated intention was to collect entire runs of characters or titles as \"big fat collections with the best price we can maintain\", in similar manner to the discontinued black-and-white Essential Marvel.\nThe series is published out of order, though have a completist goal. Marvel's Senior Vice President of Sales David Gabriel said: \"When all is said and done, the Epic volumes will fit seamlessly next to one another on readers' bookshelves, presenting a complete and unbroken run of each title.\"\nThe original announcement consisted of six titles at the pace of one volume a month, with Gabriel adding: \"Marvel's most storied titles \u2014 including Amazing Spider-Man, Avengers, Captain America, Fantastic Four, Iron Man and Thor \u2014 are going Epic.\"\nThe first book, The Enemy Within, Iron Man's 10th numbered volume, was released in September 2013. It sold an estimated 864 copies in the first month, reaching no. 129 in the top-300 graphic novel chart.\nInitial sales were steady, with October's release - Thor's 16th volume, War Of The Pantheons - charting at 127 and selling 986 copies in the month of release. November's Amazing Spider-Man  vol. 20: Cosmic Adventures reached no. 103, with 1,010 sales. The Avengers Epic vol. 9: Final Threat in December sold 943, with a chart position of 135.\nThe first Epic Collection to crack the top-100 was the 10th overall release. Amazing Spider-Man vol. 15: Ghosts Of The Past, in May 2014, sold 1,152 copies, reaching no. 81 (51 for dollar rank).\nThe series now has more than 50 lines, including licensed books, such Alien, Star Wars, Micronauts and ROM - Spaceknight.\nThe rate of publication has increased significantly since launch, with 29 Epic Collections released in 2014, the first full year of print. There were 45 in 2019, and 87 in 2024, including reprints. With the escalated rate, two sub-imprints launched in 2023 and 2025 respectively. The Modern Era Epic Collection covers more recent comic runs, and the Ultimate Epic Collection is for the 2000's Ultimate Universe.\nDC Comics launched a similar line - DC Finest - in 2024, which it described as \"affordably priced, large-size paperback collections\" providing \"a new line of comprehensive collections of the most in-demand periods, genres, and characters from across DC history\".",
