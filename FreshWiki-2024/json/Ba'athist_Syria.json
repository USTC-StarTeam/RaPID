  "summary": "Ba'athist Syria, officially the Syrian Arab Republic (SAR), was the Syrian state between 1963 and 2024 under the one-party rule of the Syrian regional branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party. From 1971 until 2024, it was ruled by the Assad family, and was therefore commonly referred to as the Assad regime.\nThe regime emerged in the wake of the 1963 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat and was led by Alawite military officers. In 1970, president Nureddin al-Atassi and de facto leader Salah Jadid were overthrown by Hafez al-Assad in the Corrective Revolution. The next year, Assad became president after sham elections. An Islamist uprising against Assad's rule resulted in the regime committing the 1981 and 1982 Hama massacres.\nHafez al-Assad died in 2000 and was succeeded by his son Bashar al-Assad. Protests against Ba'athist rule in 2011 during the Arab Spring led to the Syrian civil war, which weakened the Assad regime's territorial control. However, the Ba'athist government remained in power and was able to regain ground with the support of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. In December 2024, a series of surprise offensives by various rebel factions culminated in the regime's collapse.",
