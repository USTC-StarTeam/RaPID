  "summary": "White Fungus is an arts magazine and project based in Taichung City, Taiwan. Founded by brothers Ron Hanson and Mark Hanson in Wellington, New Zealand in 2004, it began as an intended one-off, photocopied political zine. Over time, the publication evolved into a widely distributed print magazine with an international readership.\nThe name of the publication comes from a can of \"white fungus\" the Hansons discovered in their local Taiwan supermarket in 2003. Each cover of the magazine is derived from a scan of that can. In 2009, White Fungus relocated to Taichung City, where it has since been based.",
