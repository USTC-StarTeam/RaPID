  "summary": "The eleventh season of the Argentine version of the television reality show Gran Hermano was announced on 26 March 2023, by Telefe. It is the second continuous season to air on Telefe after previously airing on Am\u00e9rica TV in 2016, as the show made its return to the original network Telefe in 2022.\nSantiago del Moro continues as the show's host. The show follows a group of contestants (known as HouseGuests), who live in a house together while being constantly filmed and having no communication with the outside world as they compete to win a grand prize. Each week, the HouseGuests compete in a Head of Household (HoH) competition which gives them immunity from nominations and the power to save one of the nominees up for eviction. \nOn eviction night, the audience votes to evict one of the nominees.\nThe season premiered on 11 December 2023, and ran for 210 days, with the season ending on 7 July 2024, becoming the longest edition to date.\nBautista Mascia was crowned the winner of the season, with Emmanuel Vich finishing as runner-up and Nicol\u00e1s Grosman in third place.\nOn 3 July 2024, Gran Hermano was renewed by Telefe for an twelfth season.",
