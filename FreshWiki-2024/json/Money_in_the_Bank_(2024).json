  "summary": "The 2024 Money in the Bank was a professional wrestling event produced by the American company WWE. It was the 15th annual Money in the Bank event and took place on Saturday, July 6, 2024, at the Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The event aired via pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming and was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. This was the first Money in the Bank event to be held in Canada, and the second consecutive to take place outside of the United States, after the 2023 event. WWE Hall of Famer and Toronto native Trish Stratus was the host of the event.\nThe event is based around the Money in the Bank ladder match, a multi-person ladder match in which participants compete to obtain a contract that grants the respective men's and women's winners a match for a championship of their choice at any time within the next year. The 2024 matches had six participants each, evenly divided between wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands. The men's match, which was the opening bout, was won by Raw's Drew McIntyre, while the women's match was won by SmackDown's Tiffany Stratton.\nThree other matches were contested at the event. In what was the main event of the card, which was SmackDown's main match, The Bloodline (Solo Sikoa, Jacob Fatu, and Tama Tonga) defeated Cody Rhodes, Kevin Owens, and Randy Orton in a six-man tag team match. This was Jacob Fatu's WWE in-ring debut. In another prominent match, which was Raw's main match, Damian Priest defeated Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins and Drew McIntyre in a triple threat match to retain the World Heavyweight Championship; the match started as a regular singles match between Priest and Rollins, but midway through, McIntyre cashed in the Money in the Bank contract he had won earlier, converting the match to a triple threat. It was also originally stipulated that if Rollins lost, he could never challenge for the title again for as long as Priest was champion, but this was later lifted out of mutual respect between the two. The event also saw a surprise appearance by John Cena, who announced that 2025 would be his final year as an in-ring performer.",
