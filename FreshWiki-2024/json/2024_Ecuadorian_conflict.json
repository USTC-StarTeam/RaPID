  "summary": "On 9 January 2024, an armed conflict broke out in Ecuador involving the country's government against several organized crime groups, most notably the Los Choneros cartel.\nReports of armed attacks throughout Guayaquil and other parts of the country were widespread, occurring primarily in prisons, markets, roads, and universities. The large-scale attacks were a combination of responses to the escape of Los Choneros leader Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Mac\u00edas Villamar in Guayaquil, and President Daniel Noboa declaring a state of emergency and then an internal state of war.",
