  "summary": "Germany participated at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris from 26 July to 11 August 2024. It was the nation's eighteenth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympic Games, except for 1920 and 1924 due to the nation's role in World War I, and 1948 for the nation's role in World War II. From 1956 through 1964, Germans competed as part of the United Team of Germany (UTG); in 1968, the team was split into two teams West Germany and East Germany. West Germany boycotted the 1980 games as part of the American-led boycott, and then returned in 1984. East Germany boycotted the 1984 games as part of the Soviet-led boycott, and in 1988, East Germany returned for the last time. One year after the fall of the Berlin Wall, West and East Germany re-united as one country with their reunification in 1990, and it has participated in every Summer Olympics since 1992 games in Barcelona.\nThe German Olympic Sports Confederation appointed Olaf Tabor as the nation's chef de mission for Paris 2024.",
