  "summary": "General elections were held in Mexico on 2 June 2024. Voters elected a new president to serve a six-year term, all 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies, and all 128 members of the Senate of the Republic. These elections took place concurrently with the 2024 state elections.\nClaudia Sheinbaum, a member of the left-wing political party Morena, was widely regarded by her party as the top contender to succeed President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and ultimately secured the nomination of the ruling coalition, Sigamos Haciendo Historia. X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez emerged as the frontrunner of Fuerza y Coraz\u00f3n por M\u00e9xico following a surge in popularity due to criticisms from L\u00f3pez Obrador. Citizens' Movement, the only national party without a coalition, nominated Jorge M\u00e1ynez. This was the first general election in Mexico's history in which most contenders for the country's presidency were women.\nSheinbaum won the presidential election by a landslide margin of over 33 points, becoming the first woman and the first person of full Jewish descent to be elected president of Mexico, as well as the first Jewish woman elected head of state in Latin America. The election saw Sheinbaum receiving the highest number of votes ever recorded for a candidate in Mexican history, surpassing L\u00f3pez Obrador's record of 30.1 million votes from 2018. Sheinbaum was officially sworn into office on 1 October 2024. \nIn the legislative elections, the Sigamos Haciendo Historia coalition won a supermajority in the Chamber of Deputies. The coalition fell three seats short of a supermajority in the Senate, but defections by the two senators elected for the PRD on 28 August closed the shortfall to one.",
