  "summary": "The 2024 United States House of Representatives elections in California were held on November 5, 2024, to elect the 52 U.S. representatives from the State of California, one from all 52 of the state's congressional districts. The elections coincided with the 2024 U.S. presidential election, as well as other elections to the House of Representatives, elections to the United States Senate, and various state and local elections. Six incumbent representatives, Barbara Lee of the 12th district, Adam Schiff of the 30th district, Katie Porter of the 47th district, Anna Eshoo of the 16th district, Tony C\u00e1rdenas of the 29th district, and Grace Napolitano of the 31st district, announced they would not seek re-election in 2024; Lee, Schiff, and Porter instead ran for U.S. Senate.\nHouse Majority PAC, a super PAC affiliated with the Democratic Party, announced that it would target four California Republicans in 2024: Mike Garcia of the 27th district, Young Kim of the 40th district, Ken Calvert of the 41st district, and Michelle Steel of the 45th district. Garcia, Kim, and Steel all represent districts that Joe Biden won in the 2020 presidential election, while Calvert's district narrowly voted for Donald Trump. There were two other California Republicans who represent Biden-won districts, John Duarte of the 13th district and David Valadao of the 22nd district. Several California Republicans received assistance from Protect the House 2024, a joint fundraising committee launched by former U.S. Speaker of the House and California Republican Kevin McCarthy to support vulnerable House Republicans. Among the representatives included in the committee were Duarte, Valadao, Garcia, Calvert, and Steel, as well as Kevin Kiley of the 3rd district.",
