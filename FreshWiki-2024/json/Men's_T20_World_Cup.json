  "summary": "The ICC Men's T20 World Cup, formerly the ICC World Twenty20, is a biennial T20I cricket tournament, organised by the International Cricket Council. It was held in every odd year from 2007 to 2009, and since 2010 it has been held in every even year with the exception of 2018 and 2020. This event was rebranded from ICC World Twenty20 to ICC Men's T20 World Cup in November 2018.\nThe 2011 edition of the tournament was brought forward to 2010 to replace the ICC Champions Trophy. This scheduling bottleneck was caused after the 5th edition of the ICC Champions Trophy, scheduled to be hosted by Pakistan in 2008, was delayed and shifted to South Africa in 2009 due to security concerns. The Champions Trophy was converted into a quadrennial tournament after that. In May 2016, the ICC put forward the idea of having a tournament in 2018, with South Africa being the possible host, but later dropped the idea as the top member nations were busied with multiple bilateral cricket events taking place in 2018.\nThe 2020 edition of the tournament was scheduled to take place in Australia but due to the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe, the tournament was postponed until 2021, with the intended host changed to India. The 2021 Men's T20 World Cup was later relocated to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman due to problems relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in India, taking place five years after the previous (2016) iteration. The capacity in stadiums was reduced to 70% of the maximum.\nAs of 2024, nine editions have so far been played and a total of 24 teams have competed. Six national teams have won the T20 World Cup so far. Three teams, West Indies (2012, 2016), England (2010, 2022) and India (2007, 2024), have won the competition twice each. Pakistan (2009), Sri Lanka (2014), and Australia (2021) have one title each. A total of 15 countries have hosted the tournament (including 6 island nations of the West Indies). India are the current champions having won their second title in the 2024 edition. The next edition of the tournament will take place in India and Sri Lanka in 2026.",
