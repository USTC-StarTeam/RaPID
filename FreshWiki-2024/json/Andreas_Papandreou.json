  "summary": "Andreas Georgiou Papandreou (Greek: \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03bf\u03c5, pronounced [an\u02c8\u00f0reas papan\u02c8\u00f0reu]; 5 February 1919 \u2013 23 June 1996) was a Greek economist, politician, statesman and a dominant figure in Greek politics, known for founding the political party The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), which he led from 1974 to 1996. He served three terms as the 3rd and 8th prime minister in the Third Hellenic Republic. His father, Georgios Papandreou, and his son, George Papandreou, have served as prime ministers of Greece.\nPapandreou spent most of the turbulent years of Greece (Axis occupation of Greece and civil war) in the United States, where he became a prominent academic economist. He returned to Greece under pressure from his father to prepare him as his successor. However, the rapid ascension of Papandreou, along with his uncompromising radical rhetoric, amplified the existing political instability, which created conditions for a group of colonels to intervene and rule Greece for seven years. Papandreou was exiled and primarily blamed for the situation. In exile, Papandreou developed an anti-American narrative, where he was a victim of larger forces. Upon his return in 1974, Papandreou created a new political party, PASOK, the first non-communist political party with a mass-based organization. Papandreou's populist rhetoric, along with the mounting pressure from the oil crisis of the 1970s on the Greek economy, caused PASOK to grow rapidly.\nPapandreou's coming to power in 1981 was a milestone in the political history of Greece because it was the first socialist elected government. In the early years, Papandreou implemented a transformative social agenda by expanding access to education and healthcare, reinforcing workers' rights, and passing a new family law that elevated women's position in society and the economy. He also achieved the official recognition of the communist resistance groups in the Greek Resistance (EAM/ELAS) against the Axis' occupation and made it easier for the refugees from the Greek Civil War of Greek ethnicity to return. However, his reign was tarnished by numerous corruption scandals, a rise in the frequency of terrorism incidents, his public divorce of his second wife for someone half his age, as well as controversial decisions that caused a constitutional crisis. Under Papandreou, the Greek economy diverged from the European average due to the mass-scale patronage fueled by misuse of European Union funds and excessive foreign borrowing, resulting in a reputation nationally and in European circles as that of a 'black sheep.'\nPapandreou died at the age of 77 in 1996, but his populism remains popular not only among the Greek people but also because it transformed the political landscape of his time that continues to exist in various forms to this day.",
