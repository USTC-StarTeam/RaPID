  "summary": "The Vallow\u2013Daybell doomsday murders are a series of killings\u2014including child murder, filicide and spousal murder\u2014committed by an American couple, Lori Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell, who led a Mormon religious group described by the journalists as a \"doomsday cult.\" The case was set in motion when Lori's daughter, Tylee Ryan (16), and younger adopted son, Joshua Jaxon \"J. J.\" Vallow (7), disappeared respectively on September 9 and September 23, 2019. Their remains were found in Rexburg, Idaho, on June 9, 2020; they had been buried on property belonging to Chad, who was Lori's lover at the time of their deaths and had become her husband by the time their bodies were found. The case also involved the killings of Lori's previous husband, Charles Vallow, and of Chad's wife, Tammy Daybell, as well as the attempted murder of Lori's nephew-in-law, Brandon Boudreaux. Lori's brother Alex Cox, who is believed by authorities to have participated in the crimes, died before he could be brought to justice.\nAt the time of the murders, Chad and Lori belonged to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church); however, their beliefs had significantly deviated from mainstream Mormonism. Chad was an apocalyptic author and publisher who claimed to have visions from the future and to have lived through multiple past lives, and prophesied the world would end in July 2020. Lori had come to share her lover's fringe beliefs; she became convinced that she was a deity destined to play a role in the coming apocalypse and that her family was getting in the way of her mission.\nTylee was last seen alive on September 8, and J.J. on September 22. In late November, after police questioned Lori about J.J.'s whereabouts, she and Chad abruptly vacated their homes in Idaho and left for Hawaii. As police searched for J.J., they discovered that Tylee was also missing. The children's case soon attracted media attention as Lori and Chad refused to cooperate with law enforcement. Investigations revealed that the children's disappearances had been preceded and followed by the suspicious deaths of Lori and Chad's respective spouses, and by a murder attempt against Brandon Boudreaux, then-husband of Lori's niece. Also, Lori and Chad had married two weeks after the death of Chad's first wife Tammy. After the children's disappearances became known, Tammy's body was exhumed by law enforcement officials, revealing that she had been asphyxiated.\nOn February 20, 2020, Lori was arrested for desertion and non-support of her children. On June 9, police discovered the remains of Tylee and J.J. during a search at Chad's home in Idaho. Chad was arrested on charges of destruction or concealment of evidence. On May 25, 2021, Lori and Chad were charged with the first-degree murders of Tylee, J.J. and Tammy. Prosecutors said that the couple had conspired with Cox to commit the murders, not only as part of their apocalyptic beliefs but also to remove obstacles to their affair and to collect life insurance money and the children's Social Security benefits, using religion to justify their crimes. \nLori and Chad were tried separately. On May 12, 2023, Lori was found guilty of all charges related to the killings of Tylee, J.J. and Tammy; on July 31, she was sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. On May 30, 2024, Chad was also found guilty of all charges. On June 1, he was sentenced to death. After her sentencing in Idaho, Lori was extradited to Arizona where she will have to stand trial twice, first for the killing of Charles Vallow, then for the shooting of Brandon Boudreaux. Her first trial is scheduled to begin on March 31, 2025.",
