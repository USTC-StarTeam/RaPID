  "summary": "Kalki 2898 AD (Telugu: [k\u0259lk\u026a]) is a 2024 Indian Telugu-language epic science-fiction film directed by Nag Ashwin and produced by Vyjayanthi Movies. The film stars an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan, Prabhas,  Deepika Padukone and others. Inspired by Hindu scriptures, it is the first instalment in a planned Kalki Cinematic Universe. Set in a post-apocalyptic world in the year 2898 AD, the film follows a select group who are on a mission to save lab subject SUM-80's unborn child, Kalki.\nThe film was officially announced in February 2020 and had working title as Project K. Principal photography commenced a year later in July 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic. It was shot sporadically over the next three years extensively in Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad and wrapped by late-May 2024. The official title was announced in July 2023. The film has music composed by Santhosh Narayanan, cinematography handled by Serbian cinematographer Djordje Stojiljkovic and editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao.\nKalki 2898 AD was initially scheduled to release on 9 May 2024, but was postponed due to unfinished post-production work. It was released worldwide on 27 June 2024 in standard, IMAX, 3D and 4DX formats. With a \u20b9600 crore production budget, it is the most expensive Indian film ever made. The film grossed est.\u20b91,027\u20131,200 crore globally and has set multiple box office records for an Indian and Telugu film, becoming the second highest-grossing Indian film of 2024 and the fourth highest-grossing Telugu film.",
