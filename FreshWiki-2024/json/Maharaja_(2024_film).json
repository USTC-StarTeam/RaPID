  "summary": "Maharaja (transl.\u2009The Great King) is a 2024 Indian Tamil-language action thriller film directed by Nithilan Saminathan. It is jointly produced by The Route, Think Studios and Passion Studios. The film stars Vijay Sethupathi, alongside Anurag Kashyap, Mamta Mohandas, Natty Subramaniam, Abhirami Gopikumar, Divyabharathi, Singampuli, Aruldoss, Munishkanth, Sachana Namidass, Manikandan and Bharathiraja. The film follows Maharaja, a barber in Chennai, who goes to the police station to retrieve his stolen dustbin only for the police officers to find his intentions to be something else.\nThe film was officially announced in February 2023 under the tentative title VJS50, as it is Sethupathi's 50th film as the lead actor. Principal photography commenced the same month, predominantly taking place in Chennai throughout a single schedule. The official title was announced in July, coinciding with the filming being wrapped and Think Studios by joining as co-producers. The music was composed by B. Ajaneesh Loknath, with cinematography by Dinesh Purushothaman and editing by Philomin Raj.\nMaharaja was released worldwide on 14 June 2024 in theatres to critical acclaim from critics, who praised Sethupathi's performance, Philomin's editing and Swaminathan's script and direction. It set several records, including the highest grossing South Indian film in China, and emerged as the fourth highest-grossing Tamil film of 2024.",
