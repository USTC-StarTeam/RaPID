  "summary": "On 2 January 2024, a runway collision  occurred at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan,  involving an Airbus A350-900, operating as Japan Airlines Flight 516 (JAL516), and a De Havilland Canada Dash 8-Q300 operated by the Japan Coast Guard (JA722A). Japan Airlines Flight 516 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from New Chitose Airport near Sapporo, Japan, to Haneda Airport in Tokyo. The Coast Guard plane was scheduled to deliver relief supplies a day after the 2024 Noto earthquake.\nAs Japan Airlines Flight 516 was landing, it collided with the Coast Guard plane, immediately igniting fires that destroyed both aircraft. Five of the six crew on board the Dash 8 died in the collision, with only the captain surviving. Everyone on board the A350 survived. Investigations have determined that Japan Airlines Flight 516 was given landing clearance, while the Coast Guard aircraft did not have permission to be on the runway.\nThe accident marked the first hull-loss accident involving Japan Airlines since Flight 123 in 1985, and also the first hull-loss accident of an Airbus A350 since its introduction with Qatar Airways in January 2015.",
