  "summary": "The 2024 English Open (officially the 2024 BetVictor English Open) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 12 to 22 September 2024 at the Brentwood Centre in Brentwood, England. It was the fourth ranking event of the 2024\u200d\u2013\u200d25 season (following the 2024 Saudi Arabia Snooker Masters and preceding the 2024 British Open) and the first of four tournaments in the season's Home Nations Series (preceding the 2024 Northern Ireland Open, the 2024 Scottish Open, and the 2025 Welsh Open). The event was broadcast by Eurosport and Discovery+ in Europe (including the United Kingdom and Ireland) and by other broadcasters internationally. The winner received \u00a3100,000 from a total prize fund of \u00a3550,400, the Steve Davis trophy, and a place in the 2024 Champion of Champions invitational event. \nJudd Trump was the defending champion, having defeated Zhang Anda 9\u200d\u2013\u200d7 in the 2023 final, but he lost 3\u200d\u2013\u200d5 in the quarter\u2011finals to Wu Yize, who went on to reach his maiden ranking final. Neil Robertson defeated Wu 9\u200d\u2013\u200d7 to win his second English Open title (following his previous win at the 2021 event) and the 24th ranking title of his career. It was Robertson's first victory at a ranking event since the 2022 Tour Championship, and he re\u2011entered the top 16 in the world rankings after the tournament. John Higgins fell to 17th in the rankings, ending his record uninterrupted tenure of over 29 years inside the top 16. \nThe event produced 69 century breaks, with 23 in the qualifying rounds and 46 in the later rounds, the highest being a maximum break by Fan Zhengyi in his second round qualifying match against Liam Pullen. Higgins made his 1,000th century break in professional competition in his last\u201116 match against Mark Allen, becoming the second player to reach that milestone, after Ronnie O'Sullivan.",
