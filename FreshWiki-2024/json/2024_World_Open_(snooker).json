  "summary": "The 2024 World Open (officially the 2024 Huading Nylon World Open) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 18 to 24 March 2024 at the Yushan Sport Centre in Yushan, China. The fifth edition of the World Open held in Yushan since 2016, it marked the return of the event to the tour after a three\u2011season hiatus due to the COVID\u201119 pandemic. It was the 15th ranking event of the 2023\u200d\u2013\u200d24 season, following the Players Championship and preceding the Tour Championship. It was also the fourth and last major tournament of the season to be held in China, following the International Championship. Organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by Huading Nylon, the event was broadcast by CCTV-5, Migu, and Huya domestically, and by other broadcasters worldwide. The winner received \u00a3170,000 from a total prize fund of \u00a3815,000.\nJudd Trump won the previous edition, having defeated Thepchaiya Un-Nooh 10\u200d\u2013\u200d5 in the final of the 2019 event. He successfully defended the title, beating Ding Junhui 10\u200d\u2013\u200d4 in the final, and claimed his 28th career ranking title to equal the number won by Steve Davis. It was Trump's fifth ranking title of the season, following his wins at the 2023 English Open, the 2023 Wuhan Open, the 2023 Northern Ireland Open, and the 2024 German Masters. It was also the third time Trump had won five or more ranking titles in a single season, having done so in the 2019\u200d\u2013\u200d20 and the 2020\u200d\u2013\u200d21 seasons. The only other players that have achieved the feat were Stephen Hendry in 1990\u200d\u2013\u200d94, Ding in 2013\u200d\u2013\u200d14, Mark Selby in 2016\u200d\u2013\u200d17, and Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2017\u200d\u2013\u200d18.\nThe main stage of the event produced 95 century breaks, with an additional 34 made in the qualifying matches played in Barnsley, England. The highest break was a Zak Surety's first career maximum break, compiled during his held\u2011over match against Ding.",
