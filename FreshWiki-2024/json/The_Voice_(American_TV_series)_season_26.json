  "summary": "The twenty-sixth season of the American reality television series The Voice premiered on September 23, 2024, on NBC. The season is hosted by Carson Daly, who returns for his twenty-sixth season. The coaching panel consists of Reba McEntire, who returns for her third season; returning coach Gwen Stefani, who returns for her eighth season after a one-season hiatus; and debuting coaches Michael Bubl\u00e9 and Snoop Dogg.\nSofronio Vasquez was named the winner of the season, marking Michael Bubl\u00e9's first win as a coach, with Bubl\u00e9 becoming the fourth new coach, after Kelly Clarkson, John Legend, and Niall Horan to win on his debut season. With Vasquez's win, Bubl\u00e9 became the first coach in the history of the show to have the top two artists on his team on his debut season. Additionally, Vasquez became the first foreign male winner, as well as the second winner of Asian descent to win, following Tessanne Chin in the fifth season. This was the fifth, and second consecutive, season in the history of the show that a coach (Bubl\u00e9) had the top two artists on their team, following Blake Shelton in seasons 3, 18, and 22, and Reba McEntire in the previous season.",
