  "summary": "Winfield Blake (July 4, 1868 \u2013 April 12, 1932) was an American actor, comedian, bass, lyricist, playwright, theatre director and producer, talent manager, and costume designer. He was the son of oil business magnate Isaac E. Blake, who founded the Continental Oil Company (later re-named Conoco and now part of ConocoPhillips) in 1875.\nWinfield Blake had an active performance career from 1889 into the early 1920s. In his early career he worked as a concert and opera singer in California from 1889 through early 1895. He spent the remainder of 1895 touring the United States and to Canada as a leading member of the Pyke Opera Company. His work then branched out into burlesque and musical theatre performances in Chicago, Washington D.C., and St. Louis before joining the comic opera troupe of Jefferson De Angelis. With that company he created leading roles in three original light operas by composer Julian Edwards:  The Wedding Day, The Jolly Musketeer, and The Princess Chic. He performed these works in runs on Broadway as well as in national tours in the years 1896 through 1901. During this period he simultaneously became a prominent national advocate for the creation of American music conservatories, opera companies, and orchestras at a time when these kinds of institutions were rare in the United States. He played an instrumental role in the founding of The American Patriotic Music League in 1897, and worked as that organization's secretary in its offices at Carnegie Hall when not touring.\nIn 1902 Blake married the actress Maude Amber. Together they formed the comedy duo Blake and Amber. The couple performed in musical comedies and burlesques together, and also wrote their own original comedic sketches and musical entertainments in addition to performing material written by others. They were active in vaudeville at Fischer's Theatre in San Francisco from 1902 to 1904 where they performed frequently with Kolb and Dill and Barney Bernard. Together, Blake, Amber, Kolb, Dill, and Bernard toured to Hawaii, South Africa, and Australia in 1904. Blake and Amber remained in Australia as members of John F. Sheridan's theatre troupe in 1905. The couple then toured Asia in 1906 with the magician Howard Thurston before spending five years working in British music halls. They gave an international tour in 1910\u20131911 before returning to England where they gave their final performances in that country at the London Hippodrome in October 1911.\nBlake and Amber returned to the United States in December 1911 and resumed performing in vaudeville in America. After 1914 their appearances on the stage diminished as they devoted their time to running a theatrical booking agency. Blake also worked as a theatrical director and producer and costume designer in San Francisco, and was a performing member of the Bohemian Club. He and his wife also co-authored musical theatre works staged in San Francisco by the San Francisco Press Club.  By 1924 they were no longer performing and were operating a costume company in San Francisco in addition to their talent management business. Blake died in San Francisco in 1932 at the age of 63.",
