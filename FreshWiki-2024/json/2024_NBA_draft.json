  "summary": "The 2024 NBA draft was the 78th edition of the National Basketball Association's annual draft. Unlike recent years, the 2024 draft took place over two nights. This was the first NBA draft to be held on multiple nights since the draft was shortened to two rounds, with earlier drafts consisting of as few as three or as many as twenty-one rounds prior to the current format's debut in 1989.\nThe first round of the draft took place on June 26, 2024, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, while the second round took place on June 27 at ESPN's Seaport District Studios in Manhattan. The time between second-round picks expanded from two minutes to four. For the third year in a row, the draft consists of 58 picks instead of the typical 60, this time due to the loss of a second-round pick for both the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns for violating the NBA's tampering rules during free agency.\nThe first overall selection was owned by the Atlanta Hawks, which they used to select French forward Zaccharie Risacher, making him the second consecutive French player to be drafted with the number one pick, after the San Antonio Spurs had picked Victor Wembanyama in the previous year's edition. France became the second nation (after the U.S.) to have at least three native players picked in the top 10 spots of any NBA draft \u2013 thanks to the selections of Risacher, Alex Sarr (drafted by the Washington Wizards with the second pick), and Tidjane Sala\u00fcn (drafted by the Charlotte Hornets with the sixth pick) \u2013 as well as the second nation (after the U.S.) to have two native players get selected with the first and second overall picks.\nBronny James, the son of LeBron James, was selected 55th overall in the 2nd round, becoming the first father and son duo to play together in NBA history.",
