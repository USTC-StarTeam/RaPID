  "summary": "The Indonesia national football team (Indonesian: Tim nasional sepak bola Indonesia) represents Indonesia in international men's football matches since 1945. The men's national team is controlled by the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI), the governing body for football in Indonesia, which is a part of AFC, under the jurisdiction of FIFA. Most of Indonesia home matches are played at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium.\nThe team is colloquially referred to as Tim Garuda (Garuda Team), Timnas (National Team) or Merah Putih (The Red and White) after the country's national emblem and their distinctive red-and-white jerseys based on the country's flag. Their fan club is known as La Grande Indonesia and Ultras Garuda.\nIndonesia was the first team from Asia to participate in the FIFA World Cup. The predecessor of the team, Dutch East Indies, participated in the 1938 edition, where they were eliminated in the first round. The team's only appearance at the Olympics was in 1956. Indonesia qualified for the AFC Asian Cup on five occasions, and advanced to the knockout stage for the first time in the 2023 tournament, exiting in the round of 16. Indonesia achieved the bronze medal at the 1958 Asian Games in Tokyo. The team appeared in the ASEAN Championship final six times. They finished runners-up on all six occasions. Indonesia has long-standing football rivalries with neighbours Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.",
