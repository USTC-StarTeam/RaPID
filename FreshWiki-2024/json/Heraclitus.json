  "summary": "Heraclitus (; Ancient Greek: \u1f29\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 H\u0113r\u00e1kleitos; fl.\u2009c.\u2009500 BC) was an ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher from the city of Ephesus, which was then part of the Persian Empire.  He exerts a wide influence on ancient and modern Western philosophy, through the works of such authors as Plato, Aristotle, Hegel, and Heidegger.\nLittle is known of Heraclitus's life. He wrote a single work, only fragments of which have survived.  Even in ancient times, his paradoxical philosophy, appreciation for wordplay, and cryptic, oracular epigrams earned him the epithets \"the dark\" and \"the obscure\". He was considered arrogant and depressed, a misanthrope who was subject to melancholia. Consequently, he became known as \"the weeping philosopher\" in contrast to the ancient atomist philosopher Democritus, who was known as \"the laughing philosopher\".\nThe central ideas of Heraclitus's philosophy are the unity of opposites and the concept of change. Heraclitus saw harmony and justice in strife. He viewed the world as constantly in flux, always \"becoming\" but never \"being\". He expressed this in sayings like \"Everything flows\" (Greek: \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c1\u03b5\u03b9, panta rhei) and \"No man ever steps in the same river twice\". This insistence upon change contrasts with that of the ancient philosopher Parmenides, who believed in a reality of static \"being\".\nHeraclitus believed fire was the arche, the fundamental stuff of the world. In choosing an arche Heraclitus followed the Milesians before him \u2013 Thales with water, Anaximander with apeiron  (lit.\u2009boundless or infinite), and Anaximenes with air. Heraclitus also thought the logos (lit.\u2009word, discourse, or reason) gave structure to the world.",
