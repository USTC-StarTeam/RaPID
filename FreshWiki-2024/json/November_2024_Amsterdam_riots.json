  "summary": "On 6 and 7 November 2024, before and after a UEFA Europa League football match in Amsterdam between Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv and Dutch club AFC Ajax, tensions over the Israel\u2013Hamas war escalated to violence. Targets of the violence included an Arab taxi driver, pro-Palestinian protesters, and Israeli Maccabi Tel Aviv fans. 20\u201330 people sustained light injuries. Five people were hospitalised. At least 71 people were arrested, including 49 Dutch nationals or residents and 10 Israelis. \nIn the run-up to the match, Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were filmed pulling Palestinian flags from houses, making racist anti-Arab chants such as \"Death to Arabs\", assaulting people, and vandalising local property. Plans to target Israeli fans for attack were subsequently shared through messaging apps with some calling for a \"Jew hunt\". After the match, a group of Maccabi fans were recorded assaulting people in the city centre, whilst Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters were ambushed and assaulted across the city. Individuals were shot with fireworks, physically assaulted, and spat on.\nThe attacks on Israeli fans were condemned as antisemitic by Amsterdam mayor Femke Halsema, Dutch prime minister Dick Schoof, King Willem-Alexander, and several international leaders. The failure to condemn the Israeli fans' attacks and the characterisation of such condemnation as \"antisemitic\" was also described as being one-sided. Some commentators characterized the event as a pogrom, triggering a debate about whether the term was applicable. Mayor Halsema regretted her own use of the word, saying it had been \"politicised to the point of propaganda\" in Israel and the Netherlands, and had been used to justify racist comments about Muslims. She also said she wished she had been aware of the Maccabi Tel Aviv fans' actions beforehand. \nThe Palestinian Foreign Ministry, Palestinian Football Association, and UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres were among those condemning the attacks and other actions of the Israeli fans as anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian racism. Four days after the riots, Halsema published a report compiled with the chief prosecutor and chief of police which said the events were caused by a \"toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger about the conflicts in ... the Middle East\", and condemned racist violence against \"all minority groups\".",
