  "summary": "Legislative elections were held in South Korea on 10 April 2024. All 300 members of the National Assembly were elected, 254 from first-past-the-post constituencies and 46 from proportional party lists. The two largest parties, the liberal Democratic Party and the conservative People Power Party, once again set up satellite parties to take advantage of the electoral system.\nThe election served as a \"mid-term evaluation\" for the administration of President Yoon Suk-yeol as it approached its third year. Additionally, there was significant interest in whether the ruling party could surpass the constraints of the ruling coalition, which did not secure a majority in the previous general election, and gain the necessary momentum to govern effectively during the remainder of its term.\nThe election saw opposition parties, primarily the Democratic Party, retain their majority in the National Assembly. The new legislators would have their first meeting on 30 May.",
