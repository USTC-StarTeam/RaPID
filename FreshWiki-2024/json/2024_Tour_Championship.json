  "summary": "The 2024 Tour Championship (officially the 2024 Johnstone's Paint Tour Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 1 to 7 April 2024 at the Manchester Central in Manchester, England. The 16th and penultimate ranking event of the 2023\u200d\u2013\u200d24 season, it preceded the World Championship. It was the last of three events in the Players Series, following the World Grand Prix and the Players Championship. Organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by Johnstone's Paint, the event was broadcast by ITV Sport domestically and by other broadcasters worldwide. The winner received \u00a3150,000 from a total prize fund of \u00a3500,000.\nThe event featured the top 12 players on the one\u2011year ranking list as it stood after the World Open. This represented an increase over previous editions of the tournament, which had featured eight competitors. Shaun Murphy had won the 2023 event where he defeated Kyren Wilson 10\u200d\u2013\u200d7 in the final, but he failed to qualify for the 2024 edition.\nMark Williams defeated the world number two Judd Trump and world number three Mark Allen in the quarter\u2011final and semi\u2011final, and then world number one, Ronnie O'Sullivan, 10\u200d\u2013\u200d5 in the final to win his first Tour Championship title, the 26th ranking title of his career, and the second of the season since he won the 2023 British Open. Aged 49, Williams became the second oldest ranking event winner after Ray Reardon. Along with O'Sullivan (48) it was the highest combined age for any two finalists of a ranking event.\nThe tournament produced 27 century breaks. Williams, O'Sullivan, and Allen each compiled six century breaks, with Allen making the tournament highest break of 142 in the quarter\u2011finals.",
