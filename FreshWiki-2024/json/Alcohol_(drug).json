  "summary": "Alcohol (from Arabic  al-ku\u1e25l 'the kohl'), sometimes referred to by the chemical name ethanol, is the second most consumed psychoactive drug globally behind caffeine. Alcohol is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, decreasing electrical activity of neurons in the brain. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies alcohol as a toxic, psychoactive, dependence-producing, and carcinogenic substance.\nAlcohol is found in fermented beverages such as beer, wine, and distilled spirit \u2013 in particular, rectified spirit, and serves various purposes; Certain religions integrate alcohol into their spiritual practices. For example, the Catholic Church requires alcoholic sacramental wine in the Eucharist, and permits moderate consumption of alcohol in daily life as a means of experiencing joy. Alcohol is also used as a recreational drug, for example by college students, for self-medication, and in warfare. It is also frequently involved in alcohol-related crimes such as drunk driving, public intoxication, and underage drinking.\nShort-term effects from moderate consumption include relaxation, decreased social inhibition, and euphoria, while binge drinking may result in cognitive impairment, blackout, and hangover. Excessive alcohol intake causes alcohol poisoning, characterized by unconsciousness or, in severe cases, death. Long-term effects are considered to be a major global public health issue and includes alcoholism, abuse, alcohol withdrawal, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), liver disease, hepatitis, cardiovascular disease (e.g., cardiomyopathy), polyneuropathy, alcoholic hallucinosis, long-term impact on the brain (e.g., brain damage, dementia, and Marchiafava\u2013Bignami disease), and cancers.\nFor roughly two decades, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the WHO has classified alcohol as a Group 1 Carcinogen. Globally, alcohol use was the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and DALY in 2016. According to WHO's Global status report on alcohol and health 2018, more than 200 health issues are associated with harmful alcohol consumption, ranging from liver diseases, road injuries and violence, to cancers, cardiovascular diseases, suicides, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. Moreover, a 2024 WHO report indicates that these harmful consequences of alcohol use result in approximately 2.6 million deaths annually, accounting for 4.7% of all global deaths.\n\nIn 2023, the WHO declared that 'there is no safe amount of alcohol consumption' and that 'the risk to the drinker's health starts from the first drop of any alcoholic beverage.' National agencies are aligning with the WHO's recommendations and increasingly advocating for abstinence from alcohol consumption. They highlight that even minimal alcohol intake is associated with elevated health risks, emphasizing that reducing alcohol intake is beneficial for everyone, regardless of their current drinking levels.",
