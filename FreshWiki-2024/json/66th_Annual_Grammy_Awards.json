  "summary": "The 66th Annual Grammy Awards honored the best recordings, compositions, and artists from October 1, 2022, to September 15, 2023, as chosen by the members of The Recording Academy, on February 4, 2024. In its 21st year at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, the ceremony was broadcast on CBS and available to stream on Paramount+, and was hosted by Trevor Noah for the fourth time.\nThe nominations were announced on November 10, 2023; SZA received the most nominations with nine, followed by Victoria Mon\u00e9t, Phoebe Bridgers (solo and as part of boygenius), and Serban Ghenea with seven each. Mon\u00e9t's 2-year-old daughter, Hazel, became the youngest nominee in Grammy Awards history; she was a featured artist on her mother's song \"Hollywood\", which was nominated for Best Traditional R&B Performance.\nBridgers was the night's biggest winner, receiving four awards: Three as part of Boygenius (Best Rock Song, Best Rock Performance, and Best Alternative Music Album), and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance alongside SZA. SZA, Mon\u00e9t, and Killer Mike received three awards each. Taylor Swift made history as the first singer to win Album of the Year four times, and engineer Serban Ghenea extended his record with a fifth award in the category as well. South African singer Tyla was the winner of the inaugural Best African Performance award.\nIn the big four categories, Swift's Midnights won the aforementioned Album of the Year prize; Miley Cyrus's \"Flowers\" won Record of the Year; Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas won Song of the Year for \"What Was I Made For?\" (from the soundtrack of Barbie); and Victoria Mon\u00e9t took home Best New Artist.",
