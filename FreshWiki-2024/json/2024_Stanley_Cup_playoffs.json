  "summary": "The 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2023\u201324 season. The playoffs began on April 20, 2024, and concluded on June 24, 2024, with the Florida Panthers winning their first Stanley Cup in franchise history, defeating the Edmonton Oilers four games to three in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nThe New York Rangers made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. Both the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs extended their respective playoff streaks to eight consecutive seasons, the longest active streaks in the NHL. For the second year in a row and third time since entering the NHL as expansion teams in the 1967\u201368 NHL season, both Pennsylvania-based teams (the Flyers and Penguins) missed the playoffs in the same season. Marc-Andre Fleury missed the playoffs for the first time since 2006.\nFor the fifth consecutive season, a Florida-based team reached the Stanley Cup Finals. For the first time since 2015, the New York Rangers became the only Presidents' Trophy winning team to hold this award twice and advance to the semifinal round of the playoffs in the last ten years. While the Oilers knocked off the division champion Canucks, this was the first time since 2018 that three of the four conference finalists \u2013 the Rangers, Panthers and Stars \u2013 were their respective division champions. During game four of the Stanley Cup Finals, Connor McDavid set the playoff record for most assists in one year, eclipsing the previous record set by Wayne Gretzky in 1988. The Edmonton Oilers became the tenth team to tie a series after trailing 3\u20130 in a series and the third team to do so in the Stanley Cup Finals.",
