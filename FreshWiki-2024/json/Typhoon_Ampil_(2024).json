  "summary": "Typhoon Ampil was a powerful tropical cyclone that threatened Japan's Tokyo Metropolitan Area since Faxai in 2019 and brought torrential gusty winds to Alaska in early August 2024. The seventh named storm and third typhoon of the annual typhoon season. Ampil emerged from an atmospheric convection east of Kadena Air Base and was later classified as a tropical storm on August 12 and named Ampil by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Ampil gradually intensified as it turned northward, reaching its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph) and a central pressure of 950 hPa (28.05 inHg) before peaking at Category 4-equivalent intensity on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale on August 16, with one-minute sustained winds of  215 km/h (130 mph) before making its closest approach to Japan. It then rapidly weakened as it began to undergo an extratropical transition on August 19. The remnants of Ampil accelerated east-northeastward, entering the Bering Sea, crossing the Aleutian Islands in Alaska, and then moving inland over the Russian Far East and Arctic Alaska before emerging into the Arctic Ocean and dissipated on August 23.\nAmpil affected Japan during the Obon holiday week, shortly after Tropical Storm Maria caused unprecedented rainfall to northern Japan. As the storm neared the coast, hundreds of thousands in Tokyo and nearby regions were urged to evacuate. Numerous modes of transportation, such as flights and trains, were canceled due to the approaching typhoon. The NHK reported that Tokyo suffered minimal damage, while several people were injured in Kanagawa Prefecture. However, Japan was struck by a more powerful cyclone named  Typhoon Shanshan one week later. Later, the remnants of Ampil caused a high surf advisory, a high wind watch, and a coastal flood advisory in Alaska, bringing strong winds and coastal waves to western Alaska. Ampil contributed to an atmospheric river when its moist core entered a low-pressure system and merged with the Pacific jet stream, which was anticipated to reach California.",
