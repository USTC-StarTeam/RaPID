  "summary": "Typhoon Man-yi, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Pepito, was a powerful and long-tracked tropical cyclone that impacted the Philippines in mid November 2024. Closely following Tropical Storm Trami and Typhoons Kong-rey, Yinxing, Toraji and Usagi, Man-yi became the sixth and final consecutive tropical system to affect the country in less than a month. It was also part of the four tropical cyclones to simultaneously exist in the Western Pacific during the month of November, the first occurrence since records began in 1951; the other three were Yinxing, Toraji, and Usagi.\nThe twenty-fourth named storm, the third violent typhoon of the season, and the sixth super typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Man-yi originated from an area of convection 220 km (140 mi) east of Kwajalein Atoll on November 8. Satellite imagery showed a more organized low-level circulation center and persistent deep convection on the southwestern periphery. As the system moved northwestward, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded it to a tropical storm, naming it Man-yi, as the system passed Guam on November 13. After spending several days as a tropical storm, the JMA upgraded it to a minimal typhoon on November 15, with the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) following shortly thereafter. Early the next day, the JMA reported that the storm reached its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a central pressure of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg). It subsequently peaked as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with one-minute sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph). As it moved west-northwestward, Man-yi made its first landfall in Panganiban, Catanduanes, later the same day. After making landfall in Catanduanes, the system slightly degraded in appearance, with the western half becoming less organized as it passed north of the Calaguas Islands. The eye of the typhoon had become more distinct, and its structure seemed to have recovered, with the development of a secondary eyewall, suggesting that the system was undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, although the cycle could not be completed. The following day, Man-yi made its second landfall in Dipaculao, Aurora, on Luzon Island. The typhoon accelerated northwestward over the South China Sea, with its low-level circulation center partially exposed and fragmented convective bands occurring along the southern and eastern edges of the system. However, the storm rapidly deteriorated as it encountered a low-level northeasterly cold surge across the northern South China Sea and experienced increased vertical wind shear. The JMA continued to monitor it until it was last noted on November 20.\nA tropical storm watch was issued for the Mariana Islands, prompting Guam to declare a state of emergency  in preparation for the storm's arrival, while a flood watch was also issued for parts of Guam and the Northern Marianas. PAGASA issued Tropical Cyclone Wind Signals for several areas, while PHIVOLCS issued warnings about potential lahar flows from Taal, Pinatubo, and Mayon volcanoes. Mandatory evacuations were ordered in vulnerable areas of Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Calabarzon and Eastern Samar. Panic-buying occurred in several locations, while multiple events and transportation services were suspended. Overall, Man-yi was responsible for 14 deaths, 15 injuries, three missing, and approximately US$58.21\u201376.05 million  in damages, particularly in Catanduanes and Nueva Vizcaya.",
