  "summary": "This page is subject to the extended confirmed restriction related to the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\nOn 23 September 2024, Israel began a series of airstrikes in Lebanon as part of the ongoing Israel\u2013Hezbollah conflict with an operation it code-named Northern Arrows. Since then, Israel's attacks have killed over 800 people, injured more than 5,000, and displaced hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians. The attacks are the deadliest in Lebanon since the end of the Lebanese Civil War, and began five days after Israel performed a deadly pager and walkie-talkie attack on devices intended for Hezbollah members, and three days after Israel performed an airstrike on an apartment complex in Beirut which killed Redwan Force commander Ibrahim Aqil as well as 54 others.\nThe deadliest day was 23 September, when Israeli attacks killed 558 people, including 50 children and 94 women. Additionally, Israel hit 14 ambulances and fire engines, killing four emergency responders and wounding 16 other medics. The attacks caused chaos among Lebanese civilians, forming traffic jams as they attempted to flee. Hundreds of schools were converted into shelters, where NGOs and volunteers worked to meet the needs of the displaced, as the Lebanese government struggled to provide adequate support. More than 50,000 people fled from Lebanon to Syria.\nA US Department of State official said the US did not see Israel's reported strategy of \"escalate to de-escalate\" as being effective. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called the attacks a \"war of extermination\" and accused Israel of trying to destroy Lebanese villages and towns. Governments and human rights organizations have called for de-escalation. Israel has rejected these calls and has said it will continue the attacks. \nOn 27 September 2024, Israel air strikes assassinated Hassan Nasrallah, who was the Secretary-General of Hezbollah. On 1 October, Israel invaded Lebanon. On 27 November, a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon went into effect, although some attacks continue.",
