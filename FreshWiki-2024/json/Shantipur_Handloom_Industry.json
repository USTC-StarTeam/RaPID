  "summary": "Shantipur Handloom Industry, also known Shantipur Handloom Cluster, is a handloom weaving industry in Nadia district of West Bengal. It is one of the foremost handloom centers of India. This handloom industry is world famous for the production of cotton Sari (saree). The two main centers of this industrial zone are Shantipur and Phulia. Shantipur has an old reputation for cotton sarees, known as Shantipuri sarees, and Phulia is well known for Tangail-Jamdani sarees.\nShantipur Handloom Industry has a long history. Handloom industry was developed in Shantipur as early as the 15th century. This handloom industry flourished during the Mughal and Nawab periods. But during the British Raj in India, Shantipur, like Bengal and other handloom industry centers of India, suffered a recession. However, after independence, Shantipur's industrial area expanded to neighboring Phulia.\nAt the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, Shantipur Handloom Industry, which depended on handlooms, was threatened by mechanized looms. In the first decade of the 21st century, the Government of India launched the \"National Handloom Development Programme\" to develop the handloom industry in India. This program has led to the development of handloom industry Centers \u2013 Shantipur and Phulia \u2013 of Shantipur Handloom Industry. During the 2010s, the number of handlooms increased more at Phulia than in Shantipur. According to 2017 data, 32,000 looms and 93,000 weavers are engaged in production in the industrial area, including 20,000 looms and 60,000 weavers in Shantipur, the main production center, and 12,000 looms and 36,000 weavers in Phulia.",
