  "summary": "During 2024, tropical cyclones formed in seven major bodies of water, commonly known as tropical cyclone basins. Tropical cyclones are named by various weather agencies when they attain maximum sustained winds of 35 knots (65 km/h; 40 mph). Overall, 119 systems formed this year, with 83 of them being named. The most intense storm of the year was Hurricane Milton, with a minimum barometric pressure of 897 hPa (26.49 inHg). The costliest tropical cyclone was Hurricane Helene, with a damage total of at least $78.7 billion, most of which occurred in the Southeastern United States. Meanwhile, the deadliest tropical cyclone was Typhoon Yagi, which caused at least 844 fatalities in Southeast Asia (particularly Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines) and South China. However, Cyclone Chido may have killed more people, particularly in Mayotte.\nTropical cyclones are primarily monitored by ten warning centers around the world, which are designated as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) or a Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These centers are: National Hurricane Center (NHC), Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC), Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (MFR), Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG), Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), Papua New Guinea's National Weather Service (PNGNWS), Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), and New Zealand's MetService. Unofficial, but still notable warning centers include the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA; albeit official within the Philippines), the United States Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center.",
