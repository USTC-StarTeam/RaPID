  "summary": "Kraven the Hunter is a 2024 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Directed by J. C. Chandor from a screenplay by Richard Wenk, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, the film stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson in the title role, alongside Ariana DeBose, Fred Hechinger, Alessandro Nivola, Christopher Abbott, and Russell Crowe. Produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel Entertainment, it is the sixth film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU). The film explores Kraven's relationship with his father and his path to becoming the greatest hunter.\nKraven was considered for film appearances several times before Sony Pictures became interested in a standalone film for the character, as part of its new shared universe, in mid-2017. Wenk was hired in August 2018, with Marcum and Holloway joining later. Chandor entered negotiations to direct in August 2020 and was confirmed in May 2021 when Taylor-Johnson was cast. Additional cast members joined in early 2022 before filming took place from late March until mid-June in London, Iceland, and Glasgow.\nFollowing two years of delays, Kraven the Hunter was released by Columbia Pictures (via Sony Pictures Releasing) in the United States on December 13, 2024. The film was a box-office bomb, grossing $61 million worldwide on a budget of $110\u2013130 million, and received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized its screenplay and visual effects, although its action sequences and Taylor-Johnson\u2019s performance were praised.",
