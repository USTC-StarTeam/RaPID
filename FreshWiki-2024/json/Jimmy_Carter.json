  "summary": "James Earl Carter Jr. (October 1, 1924 \u2013 December 29, 2024) was an American politician and humanitarian who served as the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. A member of the Democratic Party, Carter served as the 76th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and in the Georgia State Senate from 1963 to 1967. He was the longest-lived president in U.S. history and the first to reach the age of 100.\nBorn in Plains, Georgia, Carter graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946 and joined the submarine service before returning home to tend to the family peanut farm. He was active in the civil rights movement, then served as state senator and governor before running for president in 1976. He secured the Democratic nomination as a dark horse before narrowly defeating Republican incumbent Gerald Ford in the general election.\nAs president, Carter pardoned all Vietnam draft evaders and negotiated several major foreign policy agreements, including the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, and the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, and he established diplomatic relations with China. He also confronted stagflation. He created a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. He created the Departments of Energy and Education. The later years of his presidency were marked by several foreign policy crises, including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (leading to the end of d\u00e9tente and the 1980 Olympics boycott) and the fallout of the Iranian revolution (including the Iran hostage crisis and 1979 oil crisis). Carter sought reelection in 1980, defeating a primary challenge by Senator Ted Kennedy, but lost the election to Republican nominee Ronald Reagan.\nPolls of historians and political scientists have ranked Carter's presidency below average. His post-presidency\u2014the longest in U.S. history\u2014is viewed more favorably. After Carter's presidential term ended, he established the Carter Center to promote and expand human rights, earning him the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize. He traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and end neglected tropical diseases, becoming a major contributor to the eradication of dracunculiasis. Carter was a key figure in the nonprofit housing organization Habitat for Humanity. He also wrote political memoirs and other books, commentary on the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, and poetry.",
