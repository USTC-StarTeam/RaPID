  "summary": "Typhoon Ewiniar, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Aghon, was a fairly strong tropical cyclone that impacted parts of the Philippines, particularly Luzon, in May 2024. The first named storm and typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Ewiniar emerged from an area of atmospheric convection 441 km (274 mi) southeast of Palau. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) labeled the system as a low-pressure area on May 21. It intensified on May 23 and became a tropical depression, giving it the name Aghon by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration after entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility, marking it as the fifth-latest start of a Pacific typhoon season since reliable records began; the depression intensified into a tropical storm, assigning it the name Ewiniar. The cyclone made nine landfalls in the Philippines. Afterward, it began to move over the warm tropical waters of Lamon Bay, where the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and the JMA upgraded Ewiniar into a minimal typhoon. Beginning to weaken for the final time on May 30, the storm passed directly over the island of Minamidait\u014djima and began an extratropical transition. It was last noted by the JMA early on June 2, near the International Dateline, and absorbed into another extratropical cyclone just south of Prince William Sound on June 6.\nStrong winds and flooding caused power outages and transportation disruptions, with rough seas stranding over 7,175 people in various ports, and more than 152,266 people were directly impacted. In Japan, heavy rainfall was observed in several regions, with a maximum of 52.5 mm (2.07 in) of rain being recorded in Miyake, Tokyo. Agricultural damage in the Philippines totaled \u20b185.63 million (US$1.74 million). Damage to infrastructure was valued at \u20b1942.55 million (US$19.14 million). In all, the typhoon killed at least six people and left eight injured, resulting in at least \u20b11.03 billion (US$20.88 million) in damages.",
