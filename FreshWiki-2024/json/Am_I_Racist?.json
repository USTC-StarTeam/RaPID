  "summary": "Am I Racist? is a 2024 American satirical documentary comedy film starring conservative political commentator Matt Walsh that lampoons the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) movement. \nDirected by Justin Folk for The Daily Wire, it follows Walsh as he poses as a \"bumbling DEI trainee\", using subterfuge to interview experts and attend anti-racism workshops. The film has been described as a mockumentary in the style of Borat.\nWith a production budget of $3 million, the film was theatrically released in the United States on September 13, 2024. It grossed $12 million, becoming the highest-grossing documentary film of 2024.",
