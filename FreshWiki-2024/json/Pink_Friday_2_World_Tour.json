With a gross of over $108.8 million based on 70 shows, it is the highest-grossing concert tour by a female rapper and the fourth-highest-grossing tour by a rapper or hip hop artist in history.\nConsisting of 79 shows across three continents, the Pink Friday 2 World Tour was the most extensive tour of Minaj's career. It began on March 1, 2024, in Oakland, California, and concluded on October 11, 2024, in Elmont, New York. It was her first concert tour in over five years, following The Nicki Wrld Tour (2019), and her first tour within North America in over nine years, with her previous being The Pinkprint Tour (2015).
