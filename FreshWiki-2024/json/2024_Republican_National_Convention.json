  "summary": "The 2024 Republican National Convention was an event in which delegates of the United States Republican Party selected the party's nominees for president and vice president in the 2024 United States presidential election. Held from July 15 to 18, 2024, at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it preceded the 2024 Democratic National Convention, which took place from August 19 to 22 at United Center in Chicago, Illinois.\nThe convention began two days after an attempted assassination of the party's presumptive nominee Donald Trump at a campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump accepted his party's nomination on July 18, becoming the second Republican to be nominated three times for president\u2014after Richard Nixon in 1960, 1968, and 1972\u2014and the first Republican to receive three consecutive presidential nominations. JD Vance, the junior United States senator from Ohio, accepted the party's nomination for vice president. Trump and Vance went on to win the 2024 election, defeating the Democratic ticket of Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.",
