  "summary": "The 2023\u201324 South Pacific cyclone season was a below-average season within the South Pacific Ocean to the east of 160\u00b0E. The season officially started on November 1, 2023, and ended on April 30, 2024, however a tropical cyclone could form between July 1, 2023, and June 30, 2024, and still be included in the season, as shown by Cyclone Lola which formed in October. During the season, tropical cyclones will be officially monitored by the Fiji Meteorological Service, Australian Bureau of Meteorology and New Zealand's MetService. The United States Armed Forces through the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) will also monitor the basin and issue unofficial warnings for American interests. The FMS attaches a number and an F suffix to systems that are active in the basin while the JTWC designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. The BoM, FMS and MetService all use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale and estimate winds with a 10-minute period, while the JTWC estimates winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS).",
