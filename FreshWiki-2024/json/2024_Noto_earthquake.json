  "summary": "On 1 January 2024, at 16:10 JST (07:10 UTC), a MJMA7.6 (Mw7.5) earthquake struck 6 km (3.7 mi) north-northeast of Suzu, located on the Noto Peninsula of Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. The reverse-faulting shock achieved a maximum JMA seismic intensity of Shindo 7 and Modified Mercalli intensity of X\u2013XI (Extreme). The shaking and accompanying tsunami caused widespread destruction on the Noto Peninsula, particularly in the towns of Suzu, Wajima, Noto and Anamizu. Damage was also recorded in Toyama and Niigata prefectures.\nThere were 515 deaths confirmed and two people remain missing. Over 500 fatalities occurred in Ishikawa, five in Niigata and two more in Toyama. The mainshock also injured over 1,300 people and damaged 178,270 structures across nine prefectures. Of these, 228 deaths were directly attributed to the earthquake, and the other 287 were disaster-related deaths aggravated by fear of aftershocks, electricity and water outages and evacuations to temporary shelters and other locations. It was the deadliest earthquake in Japan since the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami.\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) officially named this earthquake the 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake (Japanese: \u4ee4\u548c6\u5e74\u80fd\u767b\u534a\u5cf6\u5730\u9707, Hepburn: Reiwa 6-nen Noto-hant\u014d Jishin). It led to Japan's first major tsunami warning since the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake, and a tsunami of 7.45 m (24 ft) was measured along the Sea of Japan coast.",
