  "summary": "The 2024 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2024 season. The 120th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers and the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees. It was the Dodgers' first World Series appearance and win since 2020, and the Yankees' first World Series appearance since 2009. The series began on October 25 and ended on October 30 with the Dodgers winning in five games. Freddie Freeman was named the MVP of the series, tying a World Series record with 12 runs batted in (RBIs) and hitting home runs in the first four games of the series, including Game 1 when he hit the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history.\nThe Dodgers and Yankees entered the 2024 MLB postseason as the top seeds in their respective leagues. The Dodgers had home-field advantage in the series due to their better regular season win-loss record. It was the 12th time in the Dodgers\u2013Yankees rivalry that the teams have met in the World Series, but only the first instance since 1981. Coming into the series, the two teams had played 66 World Series games against each other all-time, in which the Yankees had a 37\u201329 record along with an 8\u20133 World Series record. The 66 head-to-head World Series games was the most between any two teams by far, with the second most being 43 games between the Yankees and the New York/San Francisco Giants. The teams had previously faced each other at least once per decade from the 1940s through the 1980s. The Yankees held a 6\u20131 edge in the World Series rivalry during the Brooklyn Dodgers/Subway Series era, and the teams were 2\u20132 following the Dodgers' relocation to Los Angeles. In their 2024 World Series meeting, the Dodgers took a 3\u20130 series lead before losing Game 4 in New York. They would win their eighth World Series title the next day, coming back from a 5\u20130 deficit, a record for most runs to come from behind in a World Series-clinching game.",
