  "summary": "The 2024 World Snooker Championship was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 20 April to 6 May 2024. Organised by the World Snooker Tour, it was the 17th and final ranking event of the 2023\u200d\u2013\u200d24 season. The title sponsor was car retailer Cazoo, so the tournament was promoted as the 2024 Cazoo World Snooker Championship.\nStaged at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, the tournament was the 48th consecutive World Snooker Championship to be held at the venue, where it has taken place annually since 1977. The qualifying rounds were played from 8 to 17 April at the English Institute of Sport, also in Sheffield. The event was broadcast domestically in the United Kingdom by the BBC, Eurosport and Discovery+, and by various other broadcasters worldwide. The winner received \u00a3500,000 from a total prize fund of \u00a32,395,000.\nKyren Wilson won the event, defeating qualifier Jak Jones 18\u200d\u2013\u200d14 in the final to become the 28th snooker world champion. On his way to the final, Wilson eliminated Dominic Dale, Joe O'Connor, John Higgins, and David Gilbert in the earlier rounds of the tournament.\nThe defending champion, Luca Brecel, who had defeated Mark Selby in the 2023 final, lost in the first round to Gilbert. Unable to defend his first world title at the venue, Brecel became the 19th player to experience the Crucible curse. There were 63 century breaks compiled in the main stage of the tournament, with a further 122 recorded in the qualifying rounds. Noppon Saengkham made a maximum break in the third round of qualifying.",
