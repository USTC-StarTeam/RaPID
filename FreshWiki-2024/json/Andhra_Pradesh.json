  "summary": "Andhra Pradesh (ISO: \u0100ndhra Prad\u0113\u015b, Telugu pronunciation: [a\u02d0nd\u02b1\u027e\u0250 p\u027e\u0250de\u02d0\u0283]; code: AP) is a state on the east coast of southern India. It is the seventh-largest state and the tenth-most populous in the country. Telugu is the most widely spoken language in the state, as well as its primary official language. Amaravati is the state capital, while the largest city is Visakhapatnam. Andhra Pradesh shares borders with Odisha to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the north, Karnataka to the southwest, Tamil Nadu to the south, Telangana to northwest and the Bay of Bengal to the east. It has the second-longest coastline in India at about 974 kilometres (605 mi).\nArchaeological evidence suggests that Andhra Pradesh has had continuous human presence for over 247,000 years, ranging from early archaic hominins to Neolithic settlements. The earliest mention of the Andhras tribe occurs in Aitareya Brahmana (c.\u2009800 BCE) of the Rigveda. Around 300 BCE, the Andhras living in the Godavari and Krishna river deltas were renowned for their formidable military strength\u2014second only to the Maurya Empire in the subcontinent. The first major Andhra polity was the Satavahana dynasty (2nd century BCE\u20132nd century CE) which ruled over the entire Deccan Plateau and even distant areas of western and central India. They established trade relations with the Roman Empire, and their capital city Dhanyakataka was the most prosperous city in India during the 2nd century CE. After that, the major rulers included the Vishnukundinas, Eastern Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagara Empire, Qutb Shahis, and the British Raj. After Indian independence, Andhra State was bifurcated from Madras State in 1953. It was merged with Telangana, comprising Telugu-speaking areas of the former Hyderabad State, to form Andhra Pradesh in 1956. It reverted to its earlier form in 2014, when the new state of Telangana was bifurcated from it.\nThe Eastern Ghats separate coastal plains and peneplains. Krishna, Godavari, and Penna are the major rivers. The state has about one-third of India's limestone reserves, large deposits of baryte and granite. The population engaged in agriculture and related activities is 62.17%. Rice is the state's major food crop and staple food. The state contributes to 30% of fish production in India and has a share of 35% in total seafood exports of India. Sriharikota Range at the barrier island of Sriharikota in Tirupati district, is the primary satellite launching station of India.\nAmaravati school of art, a major ancient Indian art style that influenced South Indian, Sri Lankan, and Southeast Asian art arose from this state. Kuchipudi, one of India's classical dances originated in the state. Several renowned Carnatic music composers trace their origins to the state. The state is home to a variety of pilgrimage centres and natural attractions such as Tirumala Venkateswara temple near Tirupati, and Araku valley. Tirupati Laddu, Banganapalle mangoes, Kondapalli Toys, Dharmavaram sarees, and Pootharekulu are few products produced in the state with geographical indication registration.",
