  "summary": "Ada Wong is a character in Resident Evil (Biohazard in Japan), a survival horror video game series created by the Japanese company Capcom. Ada was first mentioned in the original Resident Evil (1996), before being introduced as a supporting character and antiheroine in Resident Evil 2 (1998). The character was initially conceived as a researcher named Linda for the prototype of the second game, but her name was changed to Ada and she was rewritten as a spy and mercenary for the final build to connect its story to that of the original. Over the course of the series, Ada is often hired to steal biological weapons for various organizations, although she betrays her employers on numerous occasions to save protagonist Leon S. Kennedy from dire situations.\nAda is featured in several Resident Evil games, novelizations, and films, and has also appeared in other game franchises such as Project X Zone, Teppen, and Dead by Daylight. Several actresses have portrayed the character. Sally Cahill, Courtenay Taylor, Jolene Andersen, and Lily Gao, among others, have provided Ada's voice for her video game and animated appearances, while Li Bingbing and Gao have played her in the live-action Resident Evil films.\nCritics have positively responded to Ada as a character, highlighting her intelligence and resourcefulness as her key personality traits. Several journalists have praised Ada's portrayal as a femme fatale, and cited her as an example of a female character who is as competent and skilled as her male counterparts. Due to Ada's Asian ethnicity, however, concerns that the character perpetuates the Orientalist trope of the \"Dragon Lady\" have also been raised. Ada's outfits\u2014particularly her red dress from Resident Evil 4 (2005)\u2014have been brought up in discussions bearing on the male gaze and criticized for being overtly sexualized. Gao's performance as Ada in the 2023 remake of Resident Evil 4 received unfavorable reviews.",
