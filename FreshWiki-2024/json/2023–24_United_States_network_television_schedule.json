  "summary": "The 2023\u201324 network television schedule for the five major English-language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers the prime time hours from September 2023 to August 2024. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series canceled after the 2022\u201323 television season. The schedule was affected by strikes undertaken by the Writers Guild of America (which began on May 2 and ended on September 27) and SAG-AFTRA (which began on July 14 and ended on November 9). Programming impacts on the 2023\u201324 season itself were limited in comparison to previous television seasons affected by Hollywood labor disputes.\nCBS was the first to announce its initial fall schedule on May 10, 2023, via press release (without an upfront presentation). However, as a result of the ongoing strikes, a revised schedule for CBS was released on July 17 (with its premiere dates announced on August 3). This was followed by NBC, which also announced its initial schedule on May 12 (with their upfront presentation at 11 a.m. Eastern Time on May 15), but later announced its revised schedule on July 19 and August 29 (along with the premiere dates), and ABC which announced its initial schedule on May 16 (with their upfront presentation at 4 p.m. that day) but later announced part of its revised schedule (along with its premiere dates on August 21), with its Tuesday and Monday schedule (along with its premiere dates) on September 12 and 18 respectively. The CW announced its initial fall schedule on May 18 (their upfront presentation of the original schedule was held at 11 a.m. that day), before it was revised on June 6 with the release of its summer schedule for the previous season, and its replacement programming was announced on July 12 (along with their premiere dates). Fox announced its programming on May 15 via press release that morning (with their upfront presentation at 4 p.m. that day), but released its Sunday schedule (along with its release dates) on July 10, along with the rest of its prime-time schedule (which was revised  due to the strike, however its original schedule wasn't announced) (with their premiere dates) on July 11.\nThis would be the first season that CBS News and Stations disaffiliated from The CW, as Paramount announced on May 5, 2023, that it would exercise the right with the transaction to disaffiliate all eight of their CW affiliates on September 1, 2023. As a result, this would be the first season that Nexstar Media Group would be majority owner of The CW, acquiring a 75-percent ownership stake; former joint owners Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery retained a 25-percent stake, split at nominal 12.5-percent stakes for both companies.\nPBS is not included, as member television stations have local flexibility over most of their schedule and broadcast times for network shows may vary. Ion Television and MyNetworkTV are also not included since both networks' schedules consist of syndicated reruns (with limited original programming on the latter).\nEach of the 30 highest-rated shows released in May 2024 is listed with their ranks and ratings as determined by Nielsen Media Research.\nBeginning this season, The CW began airing programming during the first hour of prime-time on Sundays.",
