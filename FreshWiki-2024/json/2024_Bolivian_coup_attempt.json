  "summary": "On 26 June 2024, an attempted military coup occurred in Bolivia, orchestrated by dissident officers of the Armed Forces led by General Juan Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. Armed troops occupied the Plaza Murillo in La Paz, the political heart of the country, but withdrew amid domestic and international pressure and after the appointment of a new military high command.\nThe coup followed weeks of political and economic unease, as a split in the ruling party between former president Evo Morales and incumbent Luis Arce hampered the government's ability to address a looming financial crisis. Days before the coup, General Juan Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga declared that the military would arrest Morales if he ran in the 2025 presidential election. The resulting scandal ended in Z\u00fa\u00f1iga's dismissal.\nEarly on 26 June, Bolivian Army units began irregular mobilizations, culminating by mid-afternoon in the complete occupation of Plaza Murillo. A tense standoff between soldiers and police joined by protesters lasted for three hours. The day's events included an assault on the historical Palacio Quemado and a face-to-face altercation between Arce and Z\u00fa\u00f1iga. The coup plotters lacked meaningful military or political support and were met with bipartisan domestic and international condemnation. Police forces opposed the putsch, and the commander of the Air Force backed out before a new Army commander appointed by Arce ordered all soldiers to return to their regular posts.\nFollowing his arrest, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga asserted that the coup attempt had been a ruse masterminded by Arce to drum up popular support. Opponents of the government seized on the accusation, with supporters of Morales, and the traditional opposition, questioning the administration's role in the military uprising. Arce has categorically denied all accusations of a self-coup.",
