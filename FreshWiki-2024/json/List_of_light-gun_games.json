  "summary": "This is a list of light-gun games, video games that use a non-fixed gun controller, organized by the arcade, video game console or home computer system that they were made available for. Ports of light-gun games which do not support a light gun (e.g. the Sega Saturn version of Corpse Killer) are not included in this list. Arcade games are organized alphabetically, while home video games are organized alphabetically by the system's company and then subdivided by the respective company's systems in a chronological fashion.",
