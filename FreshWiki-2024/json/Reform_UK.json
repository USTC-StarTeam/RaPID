  "summary": "Reform UK is a right-wing populist political party in the United Kingdom. Nigel Farage has served as the party's leader since June 2024 and Richard Tice has served as the party's deputy leader since July 2024. The party currently has five members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons and one member of the London Assembly. The party also holds representation at the local government level, with most of its local councillors having defected from the Conservative Party to Reform UK. Following Farage's resumption of the leadership during the 2024 general election, there was a sharp increase in support for the party. Following the election, it was the third largest party by popular vote, with 4,117,610 votes achieving 14.3 per cent of the vote in total.\nFounded in November 2018 as the Brexit Party, advocating a no-deal Brexit, it won the most seats at the 2019 European Parliament election in the UK, but did not win any seats at the 2019 general election. The UK withdrew from the European Union (EU) in January 2020. A year later, in January 2021, the party was renamed Reform UK. During the COVID-19 pandemic the party advocated against further lockdowns. Since 2022, it has campaigned on a broader platform, in particular pledging to reduce immigration to the UK, supporting low taxation, and opposing net zero emissions.\nFarage, who previously owned 60% of Reform UK Party Ltd prior to giving up his shares, had been the leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), a right-wing populist and Eurosceptic party, in the first half of the 2010s, and returned to frontline politics as leader of the Brexit Party during the Brexit process after the 2016 EU membership referendum, which had been called partly in response to UKIP's influence. The party won 29 seats at the May 2019 European Parliament election, which was the best result for any single party in the 9th European Parliament. The Brexit Party campaigned for a no-deal Brexit and there were high-profile defections to it from the Conservative Party, including Ann Widdecombe and Annunziata Rees-Mogg. Following Boris Johnson's election as leader of the Conservative Party, Farage offered him an electoral pact at the 2019 general election, which Johnson rejected. The Brexit Party decided unilaterally not to stand candidates against sitting Conservative MPs.\nBy May 2020, the British exit from the EU having taken place, the party focused on the reformation of British democracy and a name change from Brexit Party to Reform Party was proposed. The COVID-19 pandemic began in the UK in 2020, and the Conservative government imposed a series of national lockdowns. Farage rebranded the party as Reform UK around the end of the year and focused on anti-lockdown campaigning. Farage stepped down as leader in March 2021 and was succeeded by Richard Tice. In March 2024 Lee Anderson, who was elected in 2019 as a Conservative MP, defected to Reform UK, becoming the party's first MP. On 3 June 2024, Tice announced that Farage would become leader once more, with Tice continuing as chairman. The party won five seats in the 2024 general election \u2013 the first time that Reform UK had MPs elected to the House of Commons.",
