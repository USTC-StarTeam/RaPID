  "summary": "The 2024 Welsh Open (officially the 2024 BetVictor Welsh Open) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 12 to 18 February 2024 at Venue Cymru in Llandudno, Wales. Qualification for the tournament took place from 25 to 27 January at the Barnsley Metrodome in Barnsley, England. The 33rd edition of the Welsh Open, first held in 1992, it was the 13th ranking event of the 2023\u200d\u2013\u200d24 season, following the German Masters and preceding the Players Championship. It was the fourth and last tournament in the Home Nations Series, following the Scottish Open, and the eighth and last tournament in the season's European Series, following the German Masters. Sponsored by BetVictor, the tournament was broadcast free to air by the BBC domestically, with coverage on BBC One Wales and BBC Two Wales for viewers in Wales. The BBC also provided coverage via the BBC Red Button and BBC iPlayer for viewers in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland with additional coverage on DMAX. Pay television coverage was by Eurosport and Discovery+ in the United Kingdom and Europe, and by other broadcasters worldwide. The winner received the Ray Reardon trophy and \u00a380,000 from a total prize fund of \u00a3427,000.\nRobert Milkins was the defending champion, having defeated Shaun Murphy 9\u200d\u2013\u200d7 in the final of the 2023 event, but he lost 0\u200d\u2013\u200d4 to Gary Wilson in the last 16. Wilson went on to win the tournament with a 9\u200d\u2013\u200d4 victory over first\u2011time ranking finalist Martin O'Donnell. It was the third ranking title of his career, following his wins at the Scottish Open in 2022 and 2023. He advanced to a career high of 12th in the world rankings after his win.\nThe tournament's main stage produced a total of 52 century breaks, the highest of which was a maximum break by Gary Wilson in the second frame of his semi\u2011final match against John Higgins. It was Wilson's fifth maximum break in professional competition and the 11th maximum in Welsh Open history. Mark Allen made the 600th century break of his professional career in his last\u201164 match against Ma Hailong. The qualifiers produced an additional 14 centuries, the highest being a 146 break by Robbie Williams in his match against Peng Yisong.",
