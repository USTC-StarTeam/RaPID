  "summary": "Mufasa is a fictional character in Disney's The Lion King franchise. A wise and benevolent lion, he first appears in the 1994 animated film as the King of the Pride Lands and devoted father to Simba, who he is raising to inherit the kingdom. Mufasa is killed by his younger brother, Scar, who murders him to usurp the throne. His death forces Simba into exile, but Mufasa's ghost later appears to an adult Simba, urging him to return home and confront his responsibilities as his rightful heir. Mufasa was voiced by actor James Earl Jones.\nCreated by screenwriters Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton, Mufasa underwent several changes during production of The Lion King. Notably, the decision to make Mufasa and Scar brothers was intended to enhance the plot, and Mufasa was reintroduced as a ghost to give Simba a compelling reason to return to Pride Rock. The filmmakers extensively debated whether showing Mufasa's death on-screen was suitable for a children's film. Some writers suggested it should occur off-screen, but director Rob Minkoff insisted on depicting it explicitly, an unprecedented choice for an animated film. Mufasa's animation, supervised by Tony Fucile, drew inspiration from Jones's mannerisms and smile.\nJones received widespread acclaim for his performance. While some critics and audiences initially debated whether Mufasa's death was too frightening for children\u2014many comparing it to the death of Bambi's mother in Bambi (1942)\u2014the scene is retrospectively regarded as one of the most memorable deaths in film history, particularly resonating with millennials. Several publications have also celebrated Mufasa as one of the greatest fictional fathers in popular culture.\nMufasa's likeness has appeared in various tie-in media and merchandise. Jones reprised his role in the 2019 remake of The Lion King, being the only main cast member from the original film to return, while making this one of his final performances before his passing in September 9th, 2024. Actor Samuel E. Wright received a Tony Award nomination for originating the role on Broadway in the film's 1997 stage adaptation. A prequel to the 2019 remake, Mufasa: The Lion King, was released on December 20, 2024, and explores Mufasa's upbringing.",
