  "summary": "Kamala Harris, the 49th vice president of the United States, announced her 2024 campaign for president on July 21, 2024, after incumbent President Joe Biden withdrew his bid for reelection and endorsed her earlier the same day. Harris became the official nominee of the Democratic Party on August 5 following a virtual roll call vote; she selected Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate the following day. The two faced off against the Republican ticket of former President Donald Trump and U.S. Senator from Ohio JD Vance. Harris is the first nominee who did not participate in the primaries since Vice President Hubert Humphrey in 1968. It was also the shortest general election presidential campaign in history, lasting only 107 days.\nHarris rose to national prominence in 2016 during her campaign for the United States Senate. She became more widely known when she sought the party's nomination for the 2020 presidential election but withdrew from the race in 2019, citing a lack of funds. She endorsed Joe Biden and was chosen to be his running mate in 2020. After Biden and Harris won the general election, she became the first female vice president of the United States upon her inauguration in 2021.\nHarris advocated a similar domestic platform to Biden on some issues, supporting national abortion protections, LGBT+ rights, stricter gun control, and legislation to address climate change. She also supported federal cannabis legalization, strengthening voting rights, strengthening the Affordable Care Act, and federal funding of housing. Harris departed from Biden on economic issues, proposing what has been described as a \"populist\" economic agenda, limited control of grocery and food prices in response to what the campaign characterized as \"price gouging\", a cap on prescription drug costs, and expansion of the child tax credit. On foreign policy, she supported continued military aid to Ukraine and Israel in their respective wars, but insisted that Israel should agree to a ceasefire and hostage deal and work towards a two-state solution. On immigration, Harris supported increasing the number of Border Patrol agents and reforming the immigration system. A presidential debate between Harris and Trump was held on September 10 on ABC, and a vice presidential debate between Walz and Vance was held on October 1 on CBS.\nHarris lost the general election to Trump. Losses in the \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin were considered key to her defeat, which she conceded the day after the election.",
