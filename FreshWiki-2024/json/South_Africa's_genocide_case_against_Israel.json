  "summary": "The Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip (South Africa v. Israel) is an ongoing case that was brought before the International Court of Justice on 29 December 2023 by South Africa regarding Israel's conduct in the Gaza Strip during the Israel\u2013Hamas war, that resulted in a humanitarian crisis and mass killings.\nSouth Africa alleged that Israel had committed and was committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, contravening the Genocide Convention, including what South Africa described as Israel's 75-year apartheid, 56-year occupation, and 16-year blockade of the Strip. South Africa requested that the ICJ indicate provisional measures of protection, including the immediate suspension of Israel's operations. Israel characterized South Africa's charges as \"baseless\", accusing the country of \"functioning as the legal arm\" of Hamas. Israel said that it was conducting a war of self-defense in accordance with international law following the Hamas-led attack on its territory on 7 October 2023.\nTwo days of public hearings were held on 11 and 12 January 2024 at the Peace Palace in The Hague. The Court concluded that it is plausible that Israel's actions in Gaza Strip could amount to genocide and issued provisional measures, in which it ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent any acts contrary to the 1948 Genocide Convention, but did not order Israel to suspend its military campaign. The court also expressed concern about the fate of the hostages held in the Gaza Strip and recognized the catastrophic situation in Gaza. In late February, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International asserted that Israel had failed to comply with the ICJ's provisional measures and that obstructing the entry and distribution of aid amounted to war crimes.\nOn 28 March 2024, following a second request for additional measures, the ICJ ordered new emergency measures, ordering Israel to ensure basic food supplies, without delay, as Gazans face famine and starvation. On 24 May, by 13 votes to two, the court issued what some experts considered to be an ambiguous order but which was widely understood as requiring Israel to immediately halt its offensive in Rafah. Israel rejected this interpretation and continued with its offensive operations.",
