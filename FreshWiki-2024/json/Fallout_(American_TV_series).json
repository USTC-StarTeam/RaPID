  "summary": "Fallout is an American post-apocalyptic drama television series created by Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet for Amazon Prime Video. Based on the role-playing video game franchise created by Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky, the series stars Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Kyle MacLachlan, Mois\u00e9s Arias, Xelia Mendes-Jones, and Walton Goggins.\nAmazon purchased the rights to produce a live-action project in 2020, and the series was announced that July, with Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy's Kilter Films joined by Bethesda Game Studios in the production. Nolan directed the first three episodes. Bethesda Game Studios producer Todd Howard, who directed various games in the series, signed on to executive produce alongside Nolan and Joy. Robertson-Dworet and Wagner were hired as the series' showrunners in January 2022, and Goggins and Purnell were cast in February and March, respectively.\nFallout premiered on Prime Video on April 10, 2024. The series received critical acclaim, with praise for the performances (particularly of Purnell, Moten, and Goggins), writing, visuals, production design, and faithfulness to the source material. Later that month, the series was renewed for a second season. Fallout  was also nominated for 17 Primetime Emmy Awards including Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Goggins.",
