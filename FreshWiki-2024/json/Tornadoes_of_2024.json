  "summary": "This page documents notable tornadoes and tornado outbreaks worldwide in 2024. Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Argentina, Southern Brazil, the Bengal region and China, but can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during summer in the Northern Hemisphere and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe, South Africa, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Tornadic events are often accompanied by other forms of severe weather, including thunderstorms, strong winds and hail.\nWorldwide, 90 tornado-related deaths were confirmed \u2013 53 in the United States, 14 in China, 12 in South Africa, 5 in India, 3 in Indonesia, 2 in Mexico and 1 in Russia.",
