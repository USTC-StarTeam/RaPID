  "summary": "Nex Benedict (January 11, 2008 \u2013 February 8, 2024) was a 16-year-old non-binary American high school student who died the day after a physical altercation in the girls' restroom of their high school. Investigators later determined Benedict's death was a suicide caused by an overdose of Prozac and Benadryl. The incident was the subject of national media attention as some have argued Benedict's death was the result of anti-LGBTQ policies in Benedict's home state of Oklahoma.\nAccording to Benedict's mother and friends, Benedict had been bullied by classmates about their gender identity for more than a year before their death. On February 7, 2024, Benedict was involved in a physical altercation in the girls' restroom at Owasso High School. The following day, Benedict collapsed in their living room and was later pronounced dead.\nIn late February, Benedict's death began to receive widespread news coverage and vigils in honor of Benedict were held across the United States. Civil rights groups and advocates condemned anti-LGBT policies and rhetoric, and called for an investigation of the Oklahoma State Department of Education, as well as the removal of Ryan Walters, the Oklahoma Superintendent of Public Instruction. Walters defended state policies and criticized responses to Benedict's death as politically motivated.\nOn March 13, a summary autopsy report by the Oklahoma medical examiner ruled Benedict's death a suicide caused by a drug overdose. On March 14, family members of Benedict released a statement about how they did not want the finding of suicide to overshadow the severity of Benedict's injuries from the altercation.\nOn March 21, Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler deemed the bathroom altercation to be mutual combat and announced no criminal charges would be filed in connection with the altercation or Benedict's death. In response, advocacy groups called for an independent investigation. On March 27, a full autopsy report restating the finding of suicide by drug overdose was released by the Oklahoma medical examiner.",
