  "summary": "The 2024 United States presidential debates were a series of debates held during the 2024 presidential election. Three debates in total were held during the election season. The first general election debate between the major candidates was sponsored by CNN and attended by then-presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump on June 27, 2024. Biden was widely considered to have performed poorly during the first debate, with many commentators and Democrats calling for him to drop out of the race. He withdrew his bid for re-election on July 21. A second debate, sponsored by ABC, was held on September 10 between Trump and Kamala Harris; it was widely reported that Harris won. A vice presidential debate, which was sponsored by CBS, was held on October 1.\nFour general election debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) were originally scheduled to be held between September 16 and October 9, 2024. Both Biden and Trump opposed the CPD's debate format and schedule. In May 2024, both campaigns agreed to bypass the CPD and hold the alternative debates, canceling the CPD debates.",
