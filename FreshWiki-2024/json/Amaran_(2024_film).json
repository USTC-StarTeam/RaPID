Principal photography commenced in May 2023 with a sporadic schedule at Kashmir along with a schedule in Chennai, which was again followed by another schedule held at Pondicherry, and wrapped after a year. The film has music composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar, cinematography handled by debutant CH Sai and editing by R. Kalaivanan.\nAmaran released worldwide on 31 October 2024 in theatres, coinciding with Diwali, to widespread critical acclaim from critics, who praised Sivakarthikeyan and Sai Pallavi's performances, direction, screenplay, and G. V. Prakash's music.
