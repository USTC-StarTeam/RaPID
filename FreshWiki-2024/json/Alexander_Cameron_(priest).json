  "summary": "Alexander Cameron of Lochiel, S.J. (Scottish Gaelic: Maighstir Sandaidh, an t-Athair Alasdair Camshr\u00f2n) (17 September 1701 in Achnacarry Castle, Lochaber, Scotland \u2013 19 October 1746 in Gravesend, Kent, England) was a Scottish nobleman, who became a Roman Catholic priest of the Society of Jesus. \nCameron was born at Achnacarry Castle, the third son of John Cameron of Lochiel, the chief of Clan Cameron. After being fostered within the clan and raised by relatives in nearby Glendessary House, he travelled in both Catholic Europe and the British West Indies. While employed at the House of Stuart government in exile in the Palazzo Muti in Rome as \"an honourary gentleman of the bedchamber\" to Prince James Francis Edward Stuart, he converted from the Scottish Episcopal Church to Roman Catholicism. \nAfter ordination as a priest, he was ordered by the Society of Jesus in 1741 to return to Scotland. Cameron illegally ran a ministry throughout The Aird and Strathglass for the Catholic Church. According to reports by the local Presbyterian Synods, Cameron convinced so many Chisholms and Frasers of Lovat to become, \"perverted to Popery\", that he unintentionally provoked a 1744 government crackdown at the insistence of the General Assembly of the established church. This crackdown, which was with the collusion of both Lord Lovat and the Chief of Clan Chisholm, ultimately forced Cameron to flee to his native district in the Rough Bounds of Lochaber.\nCameron was assigned as a military chaplain to the regiment of the Jacobite Army commanded by his elder brother, Donald Cameron of Lochiel, the 19th chief of Clan Cameron. Alexander Cameron served in this position for the rest of the Jacobite rising of 1745.\nAfter reportedly carrying his brother off the field during the Battle of Culloden, Cameron was captured while in hiding at the White Sands of Morar. He was handed over on 12 July 1746 to Royal Navy Captain John Fergussone.\nCameron died aboard Fergussone's prison hulk H.M.S. Furnace, then riding at anchor off Gravesend in the River Thames.",
