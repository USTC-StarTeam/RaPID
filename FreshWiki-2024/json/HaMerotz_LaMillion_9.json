The Race to the Million), an Israeli reality competition show based on the American series The Amazing Race, and the first installment of Channel 12's iteration of the show. Hosted by Yehuda Levi, replacing Ron Shahar who hosted the previous seasons of the show, it featured thirteen teams of two, each with a pre-existing relationship, in a race around the world to win \u20aa1,000,000. This season visited four continents and twelve countries and traveled over 59,566 kilometres (37,013 mi) during twelve legs. Starting in M\u00fdrdalshreppur, racers travelled through Iceland, Spain, Gibraltar, Morocco, Senegal, Azerbaijan, Austria, Germany, Mongolia, South Korea, Vietnam, and New Zealand before finishing in Gibbston. New twists introduced in this season include Partner Swap. Elements of the show that returned for this season include the Fast Forward and the no-rest leg. The season was set to premiere in early 2024, although the premiere date was delayed by the Israel-Hamas war. The season premiered on 1 July 2024 on Channel 12 and concluded on 25 September 2024.\nSisters Lee and Anne Avrahami were the winners of this season, while niece and uncle Inbar Ben Atia and Avishai Regev finished in second place, and married parents Lior Dabach and Sapir Avisror finished in third place.",
