  "summary": "Naoya Inoue (\u4e95\u4e0a \u5c1a\u5f25, Inoue Naoya, born 10 April 1993) is a Japanese professional boxer. He has held multiple world championships in four weight classes, and is one of only three male boxers in history (along with Terence Crawford and Oleksandr Usyk) to become the undisputed champion in two weight classes in the \"four-belt era\". Nicknamed \"The Monster\", Inoue is known for his exceptional punching power, possessing a knockout-to-win percentage of 89.28%, with 91.30% in world title matches.\nHe is the first and only boxer to win the undisputed championship at super bantamweight, having held all four major world titles since 2023, as well as the Ring magazine title. Previously he held the undisputed championship at bantamweight between 2022 and 2023, and the Ring title. He became the first undisputed bantamweight champion since Enrique Pinder in 1972, and the first boxer in history to do so in the four-belt era.\nEarlier in his career, Inoue held the World Boxing Council (WBC) light flyweight title in 2014, the World Boxing Organization (WBO) junior bantamweight title from 2014 to 2018, and the World Boxing Association (WBA) bantamweight title (Unified version) from 2018 to 2019. He has also held the lineal championship at bantamweight and super bantamweight, and won the 2018\u20132019 World Boxing Super Series bantamweight tournament.\nIn June 2022, Inoue became the first Japanese boxer to be ranked No.\u202f1 in the world, pound for pound, by The Ring and the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board. He was named Fighter of the Year in 2023 by The Ring, the Boxer Writers Association of America, and ESPN.",
