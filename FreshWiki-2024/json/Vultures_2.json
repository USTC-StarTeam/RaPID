  "summary": "Vultures 2 is the second studio album by the American hip-hop supergroup \u00a5$, composed of the rapper Kanye West and the singer Ty Dolla $ign. It was surprise released independently by the former's YZY brand on August 3, 2024. Guest performances include Don Toliver, Playboi Carti, Kodak Black, Future, Lil Durk, Lil Baby, Yuno Miles, West's daughters North and Chicago, Young Thug, Lil Wayne, Desiigner, Cyhi the Prynce, 070 Shake, and Ty Dolla Sign's brother Big TC. The album's digital deluxe editions add guest vocals from Peso Pluma, Kodak Black, Kid Cudi and Travis Scott.\nRecording sessions were first held for the track \"Can U Be\" in 2016, two years before West started recording \"Sky City\" and six years before \"530\", which were then finalized in 2024. West and Ty Dolla Sign focused on composing Vultures 2 with collaborators after the release of its predecessor in 2024; the rapper quickly backtracked on an announcement of retirement in July 2024. The former sustained multiple delays before release, with the performers initially considering issuing it exclusively on West's Yeezy website. In March 2024, audio rips of tracks such as \"River\" and \"Promotion\" were made available for streaming online. West and Ty Dolla Sign previewed tracks from the album at listening parties in the United States throughout the same month, before holding events in international locations like Goyang and Haikou during August and September.\nFollowing the release of Vultures 2, West continuously updated the tracks. Encompassing hip-hop, R&B, house, and trap, it was noted for an unfinished sound. Themes of women, money, freedom, and redemption are present, while West portrays himself as a victim of others. A few hours before the album's release, \"Slide\" was issued as the lead single. A music video for the track \"Fried\" was also shared in August 2024. In November 2024, a video for \"Bomb\" was released, featuring a new rap verse from meme rapper Yuno Miles, which West had first premiered at a live show in August. The cover art for Vultures 2 features Ty Dolla $ign wearing an all-black costume while holding a picture of his older brother, Jabreal Muhammad, also known as Big TC, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for a murder they both deny that he had committed. \nVultures 2 received mixed to negative reviews from music critics, who mostly criticized the unfinished sound and incomplete ideas. Some panned West's lyricism, although a few critics praised aspects of Ty Dolla Sign's performances and the production. Listeners also accused West of having used artificial intelligence (AI) for his vocals on \"Field Trip\" and \"Sky City\", as well as post-release versions of \"Forever\" and \"530\". The album charted at number two on the US Billboard 200 and reached number one on the Canadian Albums Chart and attained top\u2013five positions in eight other countries, including Australia and Norway.",
