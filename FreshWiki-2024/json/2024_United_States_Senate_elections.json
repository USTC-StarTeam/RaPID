  "summary": "The 2024 United States Senate elections were held on November 5, 2024. Regularly scheduled elections were held for 33 out of the 100 seats in the U.S. Senate, and special elections were held in California and Nebraska. U.S. senators are divided into three classes whose six-year terms are staggered so that a different class is elected every two years. Class 1 senators faced election in 2024. Republicans flipped four Democratic-held seats, regaining a Senate majority for the first time in four years.\nTwenty-six U.S. senators (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 2 independents) sought re-election in 2024, while seven senators declined to seek re-election. In addition, Sen. Laphonza Butler of California and Sen. George Helmy of New Jersey--each of whom had been appointed to their respective Senate seats--did not seek election in 2024. Concurrent with the 2024 regular Senate elections, two special Senate elections took place: One in California, to fill the final two months of Dianne Feinstein's term following her death in September 2023; and one in Nebraska, to fill the remaining two years of Ben Sasse's term following his resignation in January 2023. \nRepublicans won control of the U.S. Senate by flipping an open seat in West Virginia; defeating Democratic incumbents in Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania; and retaining all the seats they had previously held. Republican gains were attributed to candidate quality and to the coattails of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who won the 2024 presidential election. Democratic candidates were elected in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin, despite Trump having won those states. No state in which Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won elected a Republican to the Senate.",
