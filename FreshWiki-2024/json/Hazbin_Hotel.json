  "summary": "Hazbin Hotel is an American adult animated musical comedy television series created by Vivienne \"VivziePop\" Medrano. The series revolves around Charlie Morningstar, princess of Hell, on her quest to find a way for sinners to be \"rehabilitated\" and allowed into Heaven, via her \"Hazbin Hotel\", as an alternative to Heaven's annual \"Extermination\" of souls due to Hell's overpopulation. The series is produced by SpindleHorse Toons in collaboration with A24, Amazon Studios, and the animation studio Bento Box Entertainment.\nThe pilot episode, released on YouTube on October 28, 2019, was made entirely by freelance animators and was mainly financed by Medrano's Patreon followers. The first season premiered on Amazon Prime Video on January 19, 2024, with its first episode also released on YouTube a day earlier for a limited release. A second, third and fourth season are confirmed to be in production. The series has received generally positive reviews from critics.\nThe popularity and success of the pilot allowed Medrano to create a spin-off series called Helluva Boss, which premiered on October 31, 2020. The series features a different cast of characters within the same in-universe setting.\nAs of January 2024, Hazbin Hotel was the largest global debut for a new animated series on Prime Video. In February 2024, the pilot episode surpassed 100 million views on YouTube.",
