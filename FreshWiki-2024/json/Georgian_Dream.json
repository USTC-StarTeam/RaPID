  "summary": "Georgian Dream \u2013 Democratic Georgia (GD), also colloquially known as the Kotsebi, is a populist political party in Georgia. It is currently the ruling party in Georgia. Irakli Garibashvili serves as the party chairman, while the former chairman Irakli Kobakhidze has served as the prime minister since February 2024. Bidzina Ivanishvili, widely considered the de facto leader of the party, serves as its honorary chairman. The party's electoral number is 41.\nThe party was established on 19 April 2012 by billionaire businessman and oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili. It won the general election in the same year, being part of an eclectic coalition also called Georgian Dream, which included both pro-Western liberal and anti-NATO nationalist parties. Subsequently, the Georgian Dream party (independent of its coalition) won the 2016, 2020, and the disputed 2024 general elections.\nGeorgian Dream originally declared itself a centre-left, pro-European party and was an observer member of the Party of European Socialists (PES). However, over time it moved in an explicitly culturally conservative, illiberal, and Eurosceptic direction, leading to its expulsion by PES in 2023. It is today described as a syncretic party, despite remaining to the left on fiscal matters. The main criticism of the party has always been its anti-Western and pro-Russia foreign policy, which the party denies. It has also been accused of vote-bribing, democratic backsliding, authoritarianism and autocratic governance.\nSince the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Georgian Dream has promoted anti-Western narratives, including baseless claims about a \"Global War Party\" attempting to drag Georgia into a devastating war against Russia. Georgian Dream has also passed legislation considered by the United States and European Union as contradicting the country's EU and NATO candidacy commitments. In 2024, the U.S. began sanctioning leading Georgian Dream officials for \"undermining democracy\", engaging in human rights abuses, and working for the benefit of the Russian Federation. GD leaders have also been sanctioned by several EU member states for similar reasons.",
