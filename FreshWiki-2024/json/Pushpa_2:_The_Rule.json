  "summary": "Pushpa 2: The Rule is a 2024 Indian Telugu-language action drama film directed by Sukumar and produced by Mythri Movie Makers, in association with Sukumar Writings. The film stars Allu Arjun in the titular role, alongside Rashmika Mandanna, Fahadh Faasil, Jagapathi Babu, Jagadeesh Prathap Bandari, Dhananjaya, Rao Ramesh, Sunil, Anasuya Bharadwaj and Ajay. It is the second instalment of the Pushpa film series and the sequel to Pushpa: The Rise (2021). The film follows Pushpa Raj, a coolie risen to the ranks of sandalwood smuggler, who begins to face tough opposition from enemies, including SP Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat IPS.\nThe sequel was officially announced a few days prior to the original film's release in December 2021, under Pushpa 2, while the subtitle Pushpa 2: The Rule was announced in August 2022. 10% of the film's footage was initially shot back-to-back with the original film. However, Sukumar decided to alter the story, which led to the film's principal photography commencing in October 2022. The film has music composed by Devi Sri Prasad, cinematography handled by Miros\u0142aw Kuba Bro\u017cek and editing by Naveen Nooli. Made on a budget of \u20b9400\u2013500 crore, the film is one of the most expensive Indian films. With a runtime of 200\u2013220 minutes, it is one of the longest Indian films ever made.\nPushpa 2: The Rule was released worldwide on 5 December 2024 in standard, IMAX, 4DX, D-Box and PVR ICE formats to positive reviews from critics. Setting several box-office records, it has earned over \u20b91,600 crore (US$180 million) \u2013 \u20b91,831 crore (US$210 million) worldwide, emerging as the second highest-grossing film in India, highest-grossing Indian film of the year, highest-grossing Telugu film, and second highest-grossing Indian film.",
