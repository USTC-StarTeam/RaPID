  "summary": "The Canadian rapper Drake and the American rapper Kendrick Lamar have been involved in a rap feud since at least March 22, 2024\u2014the release date of the song \"Like That\" by Lamar, Future, and Metro Boomin\u2014and potentially since 2013.\nDrake and Lamar began on favorable terms, collaborating on songs in 2011 and 2012. Lamar was the opening act for Drake's 2012 tour. In 2013, Lamar dissed Drake and other rappers on Big Sean's \"Control\", later clarifying that his verse was only intended as \"friendly competition\". In the ensuing years, Drake and Lamar potentially dissed each other in songs, but publicly denied they were feuding.\nIn 2023, Drake and rapper J. Cole released \"First Person Shooter\", where Cole claims that he, Drake, and Lamar are the \"big three\" in modern hip-hop. In March 2024, Lamar dissed Drake and Cole on \"Like That\", proclaiming that hip-hop is \"just big me\". On April 5, Cole dissed Lamar on \"7 Minute Drill\", but later apologized for the song and removed it from streaming services. Later that month, Drake dissed Lamar on \"Push Ups\" and \"Taylor Made Freestyle\".\nLamar dissed Drake in \"Euphoria\" on April 30 and \"6:16 in LA\" on May 3. Drake released \"Family Matters\" later on the 3rd, accusing Lamar of domestic abuse and alleging that one of Lamar's children was fathered by producer Dave Free. Twenty minutes later, Lamar released \"Meet the Grahams\", accusing Drake of sexual predation\u2014including sex trafficking\u2014and fathering a second secret child (rapper Pusha T revealed in a 2018 diss track that Drake was secretly fathering a son named Adonis). The following day, on \"Not Like Us\", Lamar more explicitly accused Drake of pedophilia. On May 5, Drake responded with \"The Heart Part 6\", denying Lamar's accusations and claiming that Drake's team gave Lamar false information about the secret child.  \nIn November 2024, Drake filed two lawsuits against Universal Music Group (UMG), both his and Lamar's record label; Drake claimed UMG used illegal tactics to artificially inflate the popularity of \"Not Like Us\", and failed to halt the release of the song, which he alleges is defamatory. In January 2025, on \"Fighting Irish\", Drake reflected on the feud and possibly dissed his former friend, NBA player LeBron James; Drake later took the song down. \nSeveral publications have described Lamar as winning the feud in popular consensus, citing music critics and social media. Some commentators have praised the rivalry's spectacle and the significance it gave to modern hip-hop, while others have criticized both artists for the way they made and responded to each other's accusations.",
