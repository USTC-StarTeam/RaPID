  "summary": "The United States of America (USA), represented by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), competed at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris from July 26 to August 11, 2024. U.S. athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympic Games of the modern era, except for the 1980 edition in Moscow, when America led a sixty-six-nation boycott in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. As Los Angeles is hosting the 2028 Summer Olympics, the United States marched penultimately before the homebound French team entered Place du Trocad\u00e9ro during the parade of nations segment of the opening ceremony. Additionally, an American segment featuring H.E.R. and Tom Cruise from Paris, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg, and Dr. Dre from Long Beach, was performed during the closing ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony flag-bearers for the United States were LeBron James and Coco Gauff. James, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, is the first male basketball player to be chosen. At 20 years of age, Gauff is the youngest American athlete and the first tennis player to be so honored. The closing ceremony flag-bearers were Nick Mead and Katie Ledecky. Mead was part of the U.S. men's four rowing team that won their first gold medal since 1960, while Ledecky, a nine-time Olympic gold medalist, became the most decorated female Olympian to be chosen.\nThe United States competed in all sports except handball and was represented by more female than male athletes for the fourth consecutive time in the Summer Olympics (278 men and 314 women).\nThe team topped the medal rankings for the fourth consecutive and 19th overall time, with a total of 40 gold, 44 silver, and 42 bronze medals. Tied with China on golds (40), the U.S. placed first in the overall medal tally via a tiebreaker (44\u201327 in silver). The occasion marked the first time in Summer Olympic history that two countries finished with an equal number of gold medals at the top. Additionally, the Americans won 126 medals overall compared to China's 91.",
