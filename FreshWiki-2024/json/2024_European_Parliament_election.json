  "summary": "The 2024 European Parliament election was held in the European Union (EU) between 6 and 9 June 2024. It was the tenth parliamentary election since the first direct elections in 1979, and the first European Parliament election after Brexit. A total of 720 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were elected to represent more than 450 million people from 27 member states. This election also coincided with a number of other elections in some European Union member states.\nThe European People's Party led by Ursula von der Leyen won the most seats in the European Parliament. The pro-EU centrist, liberal, social democrat and environmentalist parties suffered losses, while anti-EU right-wing populist parties made gains. The right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists group overtook the centrist Renew Europe group to win the fourth most seats, while another right-wing group, Patriots for Europe, the successor of Identity and Democracy, won the third most seats. In addition, a far-right group, Europe of Sovereign Nations, was formed, becoming the smallest group in the Parliament. In total, 187 MEPS (25% of Parliament) belonged to the hard-right which is more members than ever before in history.\nOn 18 July 2024, Ursula von der Leyen was re-elected President of the European Commission in a secret ballot by the European Parliament.",
