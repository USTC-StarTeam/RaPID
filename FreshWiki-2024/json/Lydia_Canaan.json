Hala Habib of Society wrote, \"in a small country that was ripped by war, there was this young girl making a difference\".\nCanaan was the first Middle Eastern artist to sing solely in English, and the first to have music videos played on MTV Europe, MTV Southeast Asia, MTV Russia, and MTV Middle East. Her musical debut was described as having defied tradition, challenged convention, and transcended millennia-old gender barriers. According to Arabian Woman, \"as a girl who grew up in the midst of a bloody civil war, Canaan was breaking down seemingly insurmountable barriers ... She rocked the establishment\". In 2015, Canaan was cataloged in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives.",
