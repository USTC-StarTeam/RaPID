  "summary": "Hurricane Milton was an extremely powerful and destructive tropical cyclone which became the second-most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded over the Gulf of Mexico, behind only Hurricane Rita in 2005. Milton made landfall on the west coast of the U.S. state of Florida, less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene devastated the state's Big Bend region. The thirteenth named storm, ninth hurricane, fourth major hurricane, and second Category 5 hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, Milton was the strongest tropical cyclone to occur worldwide in 2024. \nMilton formed from a long-tracked tropical disturbance that originated in the western Caribbean Sea and consolidated in the Bay of Campeche on October 5. Gradual intensification occurred as it slowly moved eastward, becoming a hurricane early on October 7. Later that day, Milton underwent explosive intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 180 mph (285 km/h). At peak intensity, it had a pressure of 897 millibars (26.49 inHg), making it the fifth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record. Milton weakened to a Category 4 hurricane after an eyewall replacement cycle, and reintensified into a Category 5 hurricane the following day. Increasing wind shear caused the hurricane to weaken as it turned northeast towards Florida, falling to Category 3 status before making landfall near Siesta Key late on October 9. Afterwards, Milton rapidly weakened as it moved across the state into the Atlantic Ocean, and became extratropical on October 10 as it became embedded within a frontal zone. The remnants gradually weakened and passed near the island of Bermuda before becoming indistinguishable and dissipating on October 13.\nAhead of the hurricane, Florida declared a state of emergency in which many coastal residents were ordered to evacuate. Preparations were also undertaken in Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The hurricane spawned a deadly tornado outbreak and caused widespread flooding in Florida. As of October 21, 2024, Hurricane Milton killed at least 35 people: 32 in the United States and three in Mexico. Current damage estimates place the cost of destruction from the storm at US$34.3 billion.",
