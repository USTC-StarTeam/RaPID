  "summary": "A Minecraft Movie is an upcoming adventure comedy film directed by Jared Hess and written by Chris Bowman and Hubbel Palmer, based on the 2011 video game Minecraft developed by Mojang Studios. The film stars Jack Black, Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Eugene Hansen, and Jennifer Coolidge.\nPlans for a Minecraft film adaptation were announced in February 2014 when creator Markus Persson revealed that Mojang was in talks with Warner Bros. Pictures to develop the project, with Roy Lee and Jill Messick producing. During development, filmmakers Shawn Levy, Rob McElhenney, and Peter Sollett, were initially hired to direct, while writers Kieran and Michele Mulroney, Jason Fuchs, Aaron and Adam Nee, and Allison Schroeder, were attached. In April 2022, Legendary Entertainment became involved, with Hess hired as the new director and Momoa in talks to star. Further casting took place from May 2023 to January 2024. Principal photography began later that month in New Zealand and concluded in mid-April 2024. An official teaser, which revealed the look of the film and its title, was released on September 4, 2024. The official trailer for the film was released by Warner Bros. on November 19, 2024.\nA Minecraft Movie is scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on April 4, 2025.",
