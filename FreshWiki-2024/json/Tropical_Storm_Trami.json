  "summary": "Severe Tropical Storm Trami, known in the Philippines as Severe Tropical Storm Kristine, was a large and catastrophic tropical cyclone that wreaked havoc across the Philippines and later impacted Vietnam, Thailand, and China in October 2024. It was also the first tropical cyclone in a series to impact the Philippines in late 2024, before Typhoons Kong-rey, Yinxing, Toraji, Usagi, and Man-yi.\nThe twentieth named storm of the annual typhoon season, Trami developed into a low-pressure area and later into a tropical depression west of Guam on October 19, moving westward along the southern periphery. After entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility, PAGASA named the depression Kristine on October 20. Early the next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a tropical storm, naming it Trami, as spiral bands of deep convection formed around the low-level circulation. By October 23, Trami intensified into a severe tropical storm as it moved west-northwestward and made landfall in Divilacan, Isabela. The following day, Trami emerged over the coastal waters of southern Ilocos Sur, with surface observations and radar data indicating a lee-side jump had occurred with its mid-level rotation surviving into the eastern South China Sea, leaving the remnants of its circulation center over Northern Luzon; later, satellite imagery revealed a consolidating central dense overcast, indicating a well-defined circulation with deep convection located to the south. By late October 26, both the JMA and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that Trami had reached its peak intensity, with sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) over 10 and 1-minute intervals, and a central pressure of 970 hPa (28.64 inHg). The storm made landfall the next day in Thua Thien-Hue and Da Nang and moved near the Laos\u2013Vietnam border, where its circulation center became fully exposed before making a U-turn and gradually shifted back toward the coastal regions of Vietnam. The JMA continued to monitor the system, which further weakened into a low-pressure area at 18:00 UTC on October 29.    \nPAGASA forecast that the wind flow directed towards the storm would bring strong to gale-force winds to several regions in the Philippines, prompting the issuance of Tropical Cyclone Wind Signals for various areas. A red alert warning was issued for the Bicol Region, the Cordillera Administrative Region, and the Ilocos Region, while officials from Batanes and Ilocos Norte had expressed concerns about potential further damage to their provinces, as they were still recovering from Typhoon Krathon earlier in the year. In Daet, Camarines Norte, PAGASA recorded 528.5 mm (20.81 in) of rain from Trami, marking the highest 24-hour rainfall since the 1920s and surpassing the previous record of 507.5 mm (19.98 in) set in December 2000. Coastal areas of Hainan Province in South China issued a red alert, the highest warning level, due to an approaching storm, forcing over 40,000 people to evacuate. Strong winds in Da Nang, toppled trees and billboards, while heavy rainfall in Quang Tri province caused severe flooding, leaving 18,000 people without power. In Thailand, flooding was reported in Bang Sai District, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya province. Overall, Trami was responsible for 178 deaths, with 23  people reported missing and 151 others injured, causing approximately US$426 million in damages.",
