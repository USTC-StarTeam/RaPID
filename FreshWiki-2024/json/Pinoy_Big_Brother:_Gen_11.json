  "summary": "The eleventh season of the reality game show Pinoy Big Brother, subtitled Gen 11 (short for Generation 11), premiered on the Kapamilya Channel for 99 days from July 20 to October 26, 2024.\nThis is the seventh consecutive season in which both civilian adults and teenagers participated in a season, using a similar format of both All In and Connect seasons to house them together as a single batch. This is also the first season in the entire series to feature all-female finalists, and the third season to be dominated by teen housemates, following the Lucky 7 and Connect seasons. This season is tied with Connect as the shortest special season produced by the series to date.\nFyang Smith emerged as the winner of the season against runner-up Rain Celmar. Kolette Madelo and Kai Montinola finished in third and fourth place, respectively. Smith became the latest late-entrant housemate in a special season to win the season, following Daniel Matsunaga of All In, and Liofer Pinatacan of Connect, and the third and latest teen housemate to win in a special season and the seventh teen overall to win in the series, following Maymay Entrata of Lucky 7 and Jimboy Martin of 737.",
