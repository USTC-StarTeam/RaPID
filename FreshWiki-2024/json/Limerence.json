  "summary": "Limerence is a state of mind resulting from romantic feelings for another person. It typically involves intrusive and melancholic thoughts, or tragic concerns for the object of one's affection, along with a desire for the reciprocation of one's feelings and to form a relationship with the object of love.\nPsychologist Dorothy Tennov coined the term \"limerence\" as an alteration of \"amorance\" without other etymologies to describe a concept that had grown out of her work in the 1960s, when she interviewed over 500 people on the topic of love. In her book Love and Limerence, she writes that \"to be in a state of limerence is to feel what is usually termed 'being in love.'\" She coined the term to disambiguate the state from other less-overwhelming emotions, and to avoid the implication that those who do not experience it are not capable of experiencing love.\nAccording to Tennov and others, limerence can be considered romantic love, passionate love, infatuation or lovesickness. Later in Tennov's life, she compared limerence to love madness. Limerence is also sometimes compared and contrasted with a crush, with limerence being much more intense.\nLove and Limerence has been called the seminal work on romantic love. Anthropologist and author Helen Fisher wrote that data collection on romantic attraction started with Tennov collecting survey results, diaries, and other personal accounts. Fisher, who knew Tennov and corresponded with her, has commented that Tennov's concept had a sad component to it.",
