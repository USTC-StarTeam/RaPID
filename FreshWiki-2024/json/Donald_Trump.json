  "summary": "Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who has been the 47th and current president of the United States since 2025. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021.\nTrump graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. He became president of the Trump family real estate business in 1971 and focused on luxury accommodations. After a series of business bankruptcies in the 1990s, he launched several side ventures. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted and co-produced the reality television series The Apprentice.\nTrump won the 2016 presidential election. His immigration policy included a temporary travel ban targeting refugees and nationals of certain Muslim-majority countries, and expanding the U.S.\u2013Mexico border wall; he also briefly implemented a family separation policy. He rolled back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, initiated a trade war with China in 2018, and withdrew the U.S. from international agreements on climate, trade, and the nuclear program of Iran. Trump was the first sitting U.S. president to enter North Korea; he met with Kim Jong Un, but they did not reach agreement on denuclearization. He nominated three Supreme Court justices in his first term. Trump's response to the COVID-19 pandemic downplayed its severity, contradicted guidance from international public health bodies, and included the CARES Act economic stimulus. He was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him in both cases. After his first term, scholars and historians ranked Trump as one of the worst presidents in American history.\nTrump's politics led to the Trumpism movement. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged, racist, and misogynistic. He promoted conspiracy theories and made false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency to a degree unprecedented in American politics. He lost the 2020 presidential election but did not concede, falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud and attempting to overturn the results, including through his involvement in the January 6 United States Capitol attack. In civil proceedings, he was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in 2023, and financial fraud in 2024. He was found guilty of falsifying business records in May 2024 and sentenced to unconditional discharge in January 2025, making him the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Two felony indictments related to interference in the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents were dismissed without prejudice following his victory in the 2024 presidential election.",
