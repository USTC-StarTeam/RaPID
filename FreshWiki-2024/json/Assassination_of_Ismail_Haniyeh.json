  "summary": "This page is subject to the extended confirmed restriction related to the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\nOn 31 July 2024, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated along with his personal bodyguard in the Iranian capital Tehran by an Israeli attack. Haniyeh was killed in his accommodation in a military-run guesthouse after attending the inauguration ceremony for Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian. \nNasser Kanaani, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iran, condemned this assassination and said that Haniyeh's \"blood will never be wasted\".\nThe cause of Haniyeh's death is under investigation by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Differing reports emerged as to how he was killed, ranging from a missile strike to a remotely detonated explosive device previously hidden in his bedroom at the IRGC-run guesthouse. According to analysts, the assassination exposed critical security flaws. The investigation has led to the arrest of over two dozen individuals, including senior intelligence and military officials, as well as staff from the guesthouse.\nHaniyeh was a prominent figure within Hamas since the organization's founding in 1987. He previously served as the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority and as Hamas Chief in the Gaza Strip. In 2017, he was elected head of the Hamas Political Bureau. Haniyeh was the highest-ranking Hamas political leader killed since the start of the Israel\u2013Hamas war.",
