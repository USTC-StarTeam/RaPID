  "summary": "On 26 May 2024, the Israeli Air Force bombed a displacement camp in Tel al-Sultan, Rafah. The attack, which set the camp on fire, killed between 45 and 50 Palestinians and injured more than 200. Sometimes referred to as the Rafah tent massacre or as the Tent Massacre, (Arabic: \u0645\u062c\u0632\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0645, romanized: Majzarat al-khiyam) it was the deadliest incident of the Rafah offensive.\nWhen Israel invaded Rafah and ordered the evacuation of its east, some citizens fled to other parts of the city, like Tel al-Sultan, seeking safety. One week before the bombing, Israel had designated the neighborhood as a \"safe zone\" and dropped leaflets instructing Palestinians to move there. Two days before the attack, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt its offensive, but Israel interpreted the order differently and continued its operations.\nOn the night of the attack, Israel struck the neighborhood with two U.S. made GBU-39 glide bombs. The bombs ignited a fire in the \"Kuwaiti Peace\" tent camp; many civilians were trapped and burned alive. Israel killed two commanders and two militants and injured one commander. It claimed it attacked an outside \"Hamas compound\" and accidentally set off the fire. However, videos and satellite images showed that the location of the airstrike was inside the refugee camp itself, and some sources alleged Israel deliberately targeted civilians. Military analysts stated that bombs used by Israel have a large effect radius, and therefore should not have been used in a densely populated civilian area. An investigation by Amnesty International found that militants were in the camp, but that Israel knowingly put civilians at risk. Images of the attack spread internationally, described as \"some of the worst\" of the war.",
